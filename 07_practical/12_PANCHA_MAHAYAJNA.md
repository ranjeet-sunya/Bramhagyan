              THE 5 DAILY DEBTS AND THEIR REPAYMENT          
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Every human is BORN with 5 debts (Rina):

1. देव ऋण (Deva Rina)     → To the Divine/Cosmic forces
2. ऋषि ऋण (Rishi Rina)    → To the Sages/Knowledge-givers
3. पितृ ऋण (Pitru Rina)   → To the Ancestors
4. मनुष्य ऋण (Manushya Rina) → To fellow humans
5. भूत ऋण (Bhuta Rina)    → To all beings/nature

These MUST be repaid daily through Yajna (sacrifice).
Not optional. DAILY DHARMA.

## 🔥 Why This Matters in Dwapara

```
IN KALI YUGA:
=============
• These were often neglected
• Rituals became empty
• Debts accumulated
• Karma backlog grew

IN DWAPARA YUGA (NOW):
======================
• Karma returns FAST
• Unpaid debts create problems quickly
• These Yajnas clear karma daily
• PREVENTION is easier than cure

If you practice daily:
• Ancestors are pleased (smooth life)
• Devas are pleased (protection)
• Knowledge flows (clarity)
• Humans are helped (good relationships)
• Nature is respected (health)

If you don't:
• Debts accumulate
• Karma blocks manifest as problems
• Life becomes difficult
• Relationships suffer
• Health declines
```

---

## 🙏 Simplified Modern Version

```
IF YOU CAN'T DO FULL RITUALS:
=============================

MINIMUM DAILY (10 minutes):

1. MORNING:
   • Light a candle/lamp
   • Say Gayatri once
   • Read one spiritual verse

2. BEFORE FIRST MEAL:
   • Put small portion outside for birds/ants
   • Remember "I eat after offering"

3. DURING DAY:
   • Help one person (even small help)
   • Don't harm any creature
   • Learn something

4. EVENING:
   • Thank your parents/ancestors
   • Reflect: "Did I pay my debts today?"

THIS IS THE MINIMUM.
Expand as you grow.
But NEVER skip this minimum.
