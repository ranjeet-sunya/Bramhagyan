|   ===================================                                 |

|   • Memory is at its peak — effortless memorization                   |
|   • Brain is wiring for language permanently                          |
|   • Curiosity is natural — leverage it                                |
|   • Patterns are easily absorbed                                      |
|   • This is the BEST time for rote learning                           |
|                                                                       |
|   TRADITIONAL: This was when Brahmacharya Ashram began                |
|   (though now adapted for modern context)                             |
|                                                                       |

---

### 4.3 The Upanayana Preparation

```
TRADITIONAL CONTEXT:
====================
Age 7-8 is when Upanayana (sacred thread ceremony)
traditionally occurred, initiating Gayatri.

MODERN ADAPTATION:
==================
Even without formal ceremony, this is the age to:
• Begin serious Gayatri practice
• Learn the significance of Brahmacharya
• Establish daily Sandhya routine
• Understand the student's duty

SANDHYA-VANDANA (Simple version):
=================================
Morning:
1. Achamana (sipping water with mantras)
2. Pranayama (3 rounds)
3. Gayatri × 10 (minimum)
4. Prayer for the day

Evening:
1. Achamana
2. Pranayama
3. Gayatri × 10
4. Review of day
5. Shanti mantra
```

---

## 5. Ages 8-9: Sandhi Introduction (संधि-परिचय)

### 5.1 What is Sandhi?

```
SANDHI = SOUND COMBINATION RULES
================================

When words come together, their endings and beginnings
combine according to precise rules.

Example:
रामः + अगच्छत् = रामोऽगच्छत्
(Ramah + agacchhat = Ramo'gacchhat)

The : (visarga) + अ (a) becomes ो (o) + ऽ (avagraha)

WHY LEARN SANDHI?
=================
• To read Sanskrit texts correctly
• To chant mantras properly
• To understand word origins
• Foundation for grammar
```

---

### 5.2 Basic Sandhi Types

```
THREE MAIN CATEGORIES:
======================

1. स्वर-संधि (Svara-Sandhi) — Vowel combinations
   अ + अ = आ
   अ + इ = ए
   अ + उ = ओ
   
   Example: देव + आलय = देवालय (temple)

2. व्यञ्जन-संधि (Vyanjana-Sandhi) — Consonant combinations
   त् + च = च्च
   त् + ज = ज्ज
   
   Example: सत् + जन = सज्जन (good person)

3. विसर्ग-संधि (Visarga-Sandhi) — Visarga combinations
   रामः + गच्छति = रामो गच्छति
   
TEACHING METHOD:
================
• Introduce one type at a time
• Use familiar words
• Practice splitting and joining
• Show how mantras use sandhi
```

---

### 5.3 Sandhi in Mantras

```
EXAMPLE: GAYATRI MANTRA
=======================

भर्गो देवस्य
= भर्गः + देवस्य
(Visarga-sandhi: ः + द = ो द)

धियो यो नः
= धियः + यः + नः
(Visarga before य)

PRACTICE:
=========
1. Take familiar mantra
2. Identify sandhi points
3. Split into original words
4. Rejoin with rules
5. Understand why it sounds that way
```

---

## 6. Ages 9-10: Stotra Practice (स्तोत्र-अभ्यास)

### 6.1 Complete Stotras to Learn

```
STOTRA 1: GANESHA ATHARVASHIRSHA (Selected verses)
===================================================
ॐ नमस्ते गणपतये।
त्वमेव प्रत्यक्षं तत्त्वमसि।
त्वमेव केवलं कर्तासि।
त्वमेव केवलं धर्तासि।

STOTRA 2: VISHNU SAHASRANAMA (First 12 names)
=============================================
विश्वं विष्णुः वषट्कारो भूतभव्यभवत्प्रभुः।
भूतकृद्भूतभृद्भावो भूतात्मा भूतभावनः॥

STOTRA 3: LALITA SAHASRANAMA (First shloka)

Simple verses from Valmiki Ramayana

LEARNING PACE: 2-4 new shlokas per week
By age 10: At least 50 shlokas memorized
```

---

### 6.2 Understanding Meaning

```
NOW MEANING BECOMES IMPORTANT:
==============================

Ages 5-7: Focus was on SOUND (correct pronunciation)
Ages 7-8: MEMORIZATION (sheer repetition)
Ages 8-10: MEANING (understanding what is said)

TEACHING MEANING:
=================

1. Word-by-word (पद-पाठ):
   Break shloka into individual words
   Define each word
   
2. Anvaya (अन्वय):
   Rearrange words in simple sentence order
   
3. Bhava (भाव):
   Overall meaning/sentiment
   
4. Rahasya (रहस्य):
   Deeper/hidden meaning (for curious children)

EXAMPLE:
========
सह नाववतु। सह नौ भुनक्तु।

Words:
सह = together
नौ = us two
अवतु = may protect
भुनक्तु = may nourish

Anvaya: May (the divine) protect us together. May it nourish us together.

Bhava: Teacher and student studying together, protected by knowledge.
