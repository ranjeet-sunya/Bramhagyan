-----------------------

ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः
तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं
भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि
धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्

GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS:
--------------------

भर्गः = Splendor (nominative)

यः = Who (relative pronoun)
नः = Our (genitive)
प्रचोदयात् = May inspire (causative, optative)

• The precision of Sanskrit
```

---

## 3. Ages 11-12: Meaning Depth (अर्थ-गम्भीर्य)

### 3.1 Four Levels of Meaning

```
EACH MANTRA HAS FOUR MEANING LEVELS:
====================================

1. शाब्दिक अर्थ (Shabdika Artha) — Literal meaning
   What the words say directly
   
2. लक्षित अर्थ (Lakshita Artha) — Indicated meaning
   What the words imply or suggest
   
3. व्यञ्जित अर्थ (Vyanjita Artha) — Suggested meaning
   Deeper resonance beyond words
   
4. रहस्य अर्थ (Rahasya Artha) — Secret meaning
   Esoteric/mystical interpretation

EXAMPLE: ॐ नमः शिवाय
------------------------
Literal: "Salutations to Shiva"
Indicated: "I surrender to the auspicious one"
Suggested: "I merge with pure consciousness"
Secret: "The five letters are five elements, 
         OM is the sixth (Shakti), dissolution of all"
```

MAHAVAKYAS (Great Statements):

   "Consciousness is Brahman" — Aitareya Upanishad
   Ultimate reality is pure awareness

4. "अयम् आत्मा ब्रह्म" (Ayam Atma Brahma)
   "This Self is Brahman" — Mandukya Upanishad
   The witness consciousness is the Absolute

TEACHING APPROACH:
