Style: Mystical seascape, bioluminescent water
```

### PROMPT 2: Vedic-Scientific Split
```
LEFT (Vedic): Purna mantra with visual metaphor
- Full pot (universe) poured from full pot (Brahman)
- Both remain full after
RIGHT (Scientific): Conservation laws

- Information conservation: No data lost
Connection: Same principle, different expression
```

### PROMPT 3: Practical Example
