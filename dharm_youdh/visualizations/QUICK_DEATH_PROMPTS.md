## 🎯 TOP 10 PRIORITY PROMPTS

### 1. COMPLETE 72-HOUR TIMELINE (Most Important)

```
Create a detailed 4-panel horizontal timeline showing the death process over 72 hours: PANEL 1 (T-72h): Person sitting in bed, eyes distant, subtle golden glow fading from head. Brilliant white point (Atman) separating from crown, connected by thinning golden thread. Person appears "not fully present." Family member holding hand, concerned. Energy aura 80% brightness. PANEL 2 (T-24h): Person lying in bed, very weak. Transparent body showing miniature golden sun at solar plexus dimmed to 30%, flickering orange. Atman point much further above, thread very thin. Skin pale, breathing slower. Medical monitor showing declining vitals. Energy aura 30%. PANEL 3 (T-6h): Person very still, eyes half-closed. Blue-green Prana withdrawing from hands/feet (cold, bluish), concentrating toward heart. Internal sun dim ember at 5%. Atman far above, thread barely visible. Breath shallow. Energy aura 5% at core only. PANEL 4 (T-0): Person still, peaceful but lifeless. Last wisp of blue-green Prana leaving through crown. Internal sun extinguished. Atman completely separated, floating away. Thread severed. No energy aura. Body just matter. Family present, one crying. Style: Medical illustration meets spiritual art, cinematic lighting, photorealistic with translucent energy overlays, dramatic but respectful, educational. Each panel labeled with timestamp. 16:9, 8K.

### 2. ATMAN WITHDRAWAL (T-72h)

```
Close-up intimate scene of consciousness beginning to withdraw: Elderly person sitting in chair by window, afternoon light streaming in. Their body shown semi-transparent revealing internal energy systems. At the crown of the head, a brilliant white star-point (Atman/pure consciousness) is slowly pulling away from the body, still connected by a thick golden thread that's beginning to thin. The person's eyes are open but distant, unfocused, looking "through" rather than "at" things. A loved one is speaking to them but the person seems not fully present, responding slowly, distracted. The internal sun (miniature golden sphere) at their solar plexus is still bright but starting to flicker slightly. Seven chakras visible as colored spinning wheels, all still active but the crown chakra showing the Atman-point beginning to separate. 72,000 Nadis (energy channels) glowing blue-green throughout body, all still active. Prana field (blue-green aura) extending 2 feet around body, full but beginning to contract slightly. The person's face shows a subtle change - still alive but something ineffable is different, a quality of "presence" beginning to fade. Caption: "T-72 hours: The consciousness begins its journey home." Style: Intimate portrait photography meets spiritual energy visualization, soft natural lighting, photorealistic human with translucent energy overlays, profound and gentle, 4:5 portrait, 8K.
```

### 3. INTERNAL SUN DIMMING (T-24h)

```
Detailed cross-section view of human torso showing the "internal sun" losing power: Person lying in hospital bed, body shown as transparent revealing internal anatomy and energy systems. At the solar plexus (Manipura chakra) and heart region, visualize a miniature sun - a golden glowing sphere about the size of a grapefruit. This sun is dimming from bright gold to dull orange, brightness reduced to 30% of normal. Rays of golden light that normally radiate throughout the body are now weak and flickering. The sun's surface shows dark spots, like a dying star. Around the sun, show the major organs: heart (beating weakly), lungs (breathing shallowly), liver, kidneys, stomach - all showing reduced vitality, colors slightly dulled. The Prana network (72,000 Nadis) shown as glowing blue-green channels throughout body, but many channels now flickering or dark. Chakras visible as colored wheels along spine, spinning noticeably slower. The Atman (white point) now 3 feet above the body, golden thread connecting it to crown chakra thinned to 40% thickness. Medical equipment visible: IV drip, oxygen tube, heart monitor showing irregular rhythm. Person's face showing extreme weakness, eyes closed, skin pale. Family member sitting beside bed. Energy field around body contracted to 1 foot, patchy. Caption: "T-24 hours: The internal sun dims - the consciousness-to-energy converter fails." Style: Medical cutaway illustration meets energy visualization, clinical lighting with inner glow from dimming sun, photorealistic anatomy with stylized energy systems, educational and profound, 16:9, 8K.
```

### 4. PRANA COLLAPSE (T-6h)

```
Dramatic visualization of life force withdrawing from extremities: Person lying very still in bed, body shown completely transparent to reveal the Prana (life force) movement. Blue-green glowing energy (Prana) is visibly flowing INWARD from the hands and feet toward the heart/core, shown as directional streams with arrows. Hands and feet appear cold and blue-tinted (reduced circulation), while the core still has some warmth. The internal sun at solar plexus is now just a dark red ember, barely glowing (5% brightness). The 72,000 Nadis (energy channels) are mostly dark - only the central Sushumna channel and a few major channels still have faint blue-green glow. Chakras: only root and crown show any activity, others completely stopped. The Atman (white consciousness point) is now 6 feet above the body, golden thread barely visible (10% thickness), looking like it could snap at any moment. Person's breathing is very shallow and irregular (Cheyne-Stokes pattern). Skin very pale, almost gray. Eyes half-open but unseeing. Medical monitors showing critical vitals: heart rate 40 and irregular, blood pressure 60/30, oxygen saturation 75%. Family members gathered around bed, some holding hands, praying. The Prana streams from extremities are clearly visible flowing like rivers of blue-green light toward the heart, gathering there, preparing for final exit. Energy field around body almost gone, only faint glow at core. Caption: "T-6 hours: Prana collapses inward, gathering for final departure." Style: Medical realism with dramatic energy visualization, low lighting with glowing energy streams prominent, photorealistic with bioluminescent Prana flows, solemn and powerful, 16:9, 8K.
```

### 5. LAST BREATH - PRANA EXIT (T-0)

```
The precise moment of the last breath and Prana departure: Split-second capture of the exact moment. Person lying peacefully, body completely still, mouth slightly open from final exhalation. From the crown chakra (top of head), a delicate stream of blue-green luminescent energy (Prana) is flowing upward and out, like a gentle fountain of light, dissipating into the air above. This stream is beautiful, ethereal, about 6 inches wide, flowing smoothly upward. The internal sun at solar plexus is now completely dark - a cold, gray sphere with no light. All 72,000 Nadis are dark - no energy in any channel. All 7 chakras have stopped spinning - wheels are still, no color, no movement. The Atman (white consciousness point) is now completely separated from the body, floating 10 feet above, moving away toward cosmic space. The golden thread that connected it to the crown is severed - you can see the broken ends, one attached to the Atman floating away, one dangling from the crown where Prana is exiting. The body itself looks peaceful but definitively lifeless - skin gray, no inner glow, no energy field whatsoever. Medical monitors all showing flatlines - ECG straight line, blood pressure 0/0, oxygen --. Family members present: one person has just realized the breath has stopped, hand to mouth, tears starting. Another person holding the deceased's hand, head bowed. A third person standing back, witnessing. The room has a profound stillness. The Prana stream exiting the crown is the only movement, the only light in an otherwise still and dark scene. Caption: "T-0: The last breath - Prana departs. Atman left 72 hours ago." Style: Cinematic moment capture, dramatic lighting focused on the Prana exit stream, photorealistic with ethereal energy visualization, profound and sacred, respectful and beautiful, 16:9, 8K.
```

### 6. BEFORE VS AFTER (Split Screen)

```
Dramatic split-screen comparison, same person one second before and after last breath: LEFT SIDE "T-1 Second: Still Alive" - Person taking last breath (inhale visible). Body transparent showing: Internal sun dark red ember (2% brightness), tiny Prana pool at heart (blue-green), only Sushumna channel faintly glowing, only root and crown chakras barely active, Atman very far above with thread almost severed (1% connection). Chest rising slightly, subtle movement, faint core warmth. Medical monitors showing final irregular heartbeats. ECG showing last QRS complex. Eyes half-open, pupils dilated. Skin gray but not completely lifeless. Microscopic inset showing: neurons firing last action potentials, heart cells final contractions, blood barely flowing, mitochondria sputtering. Status: "ALIVE - T-1 second" Vitals: HR 30, BP 40/20, RR 2/min, O2 65%. RIGHT SIDE "T+1 Second: Deceased" - Same person one second later after exhalation. Body transparent showing: Internal sun completely dark/extinguished/cold, Prana GONE (last wisp exiting crown visible), all Nadis completely dark, all chakras stopped, Atman completely separated floating away, thread severed with broken ends visible. Chest completely still, no movement, body cooling. Medical monitors flatlined. ECG straight line with alarm. Eyes glossy, no life. Skin perceptibly grayer. Microscopic inset showing: no neuronal activity, no heart contraction, blood static, mitochondria dark. Status: "DECEASED - T+1 second" Vitals: All flatlined HR 0, BP 0/0, RR 0, O2 --. CENTER: Prominent vertical line labeled "ONE SECOND - ONE BREATH - EVERYTHING CHANGES" with arrow showing last exhalation as blue-green wisp. Bottom caption: "The moment between life and death is one breath, one second. But the process began 72 hours ago." Style: Clinical split-screen comparison, dramatic contrast, photorealistic with energy overlays, educational and impactful, 16:9, 8K.

### 7. MULTI-LEVEL DECAY CASCADE

```
Seven-level simultaneous visualization showing death cascading through all scales: Arrange seven horizontal bands stacked vertically, each showing the same moment (T-0, last breath) at different scales: LEVEL 1 (Top): Cosmic - The Atman (white star) departing from Earth, returning to cosmic source, shown against starfield. LEVEL 2: Human - Full body view, person lying still, Prana exiting crown, internal sun dark, all systems shut down. LEVEL 3: Organ - Heart cross-section, final contraction ending, cells losing energy, blood flow stopping. LEVEL 4: Cellular - Individual cells shown, mitochondria going dark, ATP production ceasing, membrane potential collapsing. LEVEL 5: Molecular - DNA double helix slowing its vibration, proteins denaturing, molecular bonds weakening. LEVEL 6: Atomic - Atoms still vibrating but losing coherent organization, electron clouds becoming chaotic. LEVEL 7 (Bottom): Quantum - Wave functions collapsing, quantum coherence lost, returning to random quantum foam. Each level connected by vertical arrows showing the cascade effect - consciousness withdrawal at cosmic level triggers shutdown at human level, which triggers organ failure, which triggers cellular death, which triggers molecular breakdown, which triggers atomic disorganization, which triggers quantum decoherence. All seven levels shown simultaneously at the same timestamp (T-0). Color coding: Warm colors (gold, orange) for active/alive states fading to cold colors (blue, gray, black) for inactive/dead states. Each level labeled with scale indicator (cosmic, human, organ, cellular, molecular, atomic, quantum). The fractal pattern of death visible - same process at every scale. Style: Scientific educational visualization, multi-scale composite, clean modern design, color-coded for clarity, fractal self-similarity emphasized, suitable for teaching, vertical composition, 8K.

### 8. PANCHA KOSHA DISSOLUTION

```
Five concentric human silhouettes peeling away like onion layers: Center figure of person in meditation pose (deceased), shown solid and gray (physical body only). Around this center, five progressively larger translucent human-shaped layers peeling away and floating outward: LAYER 1 (Innermost, just separating): Annamaya Kosha (Physical sheath) - Brown/earth-toned, solid matter, the actual body being left behind. LAYER 2: Pranamaya Kosha (Energy sheath) - Blue-green glowing layer showing 72,000 Nadis, chakras, Prana network, actively separating and dissolving. LAYER 3: Manomaya Kosha (Mental sheath) - Yellow luminous layer showing thought forms, emotions, memories as swirling patterns, breaking apart into fragments. LAYER 4: Vijnanamaya Kosha (Intellectual sheath) - Indigo layer showing geometric patterns, knowledge structures, wisdom accumulated, dissolving into light. LAYER 5 (Outermost, almost completely separated): Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss sheath) - White-gold radiant layer, pure and formless, merging with cosmic background. At the very center, beyond all five layers, a brilliant white point of light (Atman/pure consciousness) is revealed, completely separate from all sheaths, untouched, eternal, moving away from the discarded layers. Show the layers at different stages of separation: Annamaya still attached (body), Pranamaya just separating (T-0), Manomaya half-dissolved (T-24h), Vijnanamaya mostly gone (T-48h), Anandamaya completely separated (T-72h). Timeline arrow on side showing which layer dissolves when. The visual metaphor of "peeling away" is clear - like removing layers of clothing to reveal what was always underneath. Background: Cosmic void with subtle Om symbol. Caption: "Death as the dissolution of the five sheaths, revealing the eternal Atman that was never born and can never die." Style: Spiritual art meets anatomical illustration, translucent overlays, ethereal lighting, profound and beautiful, suitable for meditation and teaching, vertical composition, 8K.

### 9. EXIT POINTS (Seven Chakra Variations)

```
Seven variations of the same person showing different Prana exit points based on consciousness level: Arrange in a grid (3 top, 3 middle, 1 bottom center): TOP ROW (Highest): 1. CROWN EXIT (Sahasrara) - Enlightened being, Prana exiting smoothly through crown in brilliant white-gold stream, face peaceful and radiant, destination: Moksha (liberation). Caption: "Jivanmukta - Liberated soul" 2. THIRD EYE EXIT (Ajna) - Advanced yogi, Prana exiting through forehead in indigo stream, face serene and aware, destination: Higher Lokas (elevated realms). Caption: "Yogi - Conscious departure" 3. THROAT EXIT (Vishuddha) - Artist/teacher, Prana exiting through throat in blue stream, face calm, destination: Creative realms. Caption: "Creator - Expression realm" MIDDLE ROW (Intermediate): 4. HEART EXIT (Anahata) - Devotee/Bhakta, Prana exiting through heart in green-pink stream, face loving and peaceful, destination: Svarga/Heaven. Caption: "Bhakta - Devotional path" 5. SOLAR PLEXUS EXIT (Manipura) - Average person, Prana exiting through solar plexus in yellow stream, face neutral, destination: Bhuloka (rebirth on Earth). Caption: "Average - Return to Earth" 6. SACRAL EXIT (Svadhisthana) - Desire-driven person, Prana exiting through lower abdomen in orange stream, face showing attachment, destination: Lower realms. Caption: "Attached - Desire realms" BOTTOM CENTER (Lowest): 7. ROOT EXIT (Muladhara) - Tamas-heavy person, Prana exiting through base of spine in dark red stream, face showing fear/confusion, destination: Lowest realms. Caption: "Tamas-bound - Dense realms" Each figure shown in same pose (lying down, just after last breath) but with Prana stream exiting from different chakra point. Color of Prana stream matches chakra color. Facial expression and body energy field reflects consciousness level. Background gradient from bright (top) to dark (bottom) showing destination realms. Center text: "Exit point determined by lifetime Guna accumulation and consciousness level at death." Style: Comparative spiritual anatomy, clean educational design, color-coded by chakra, respectful of all levels, suitable for teaching karma and consciousness, grid layout, 8K.

### 10. MEDICAL-VEDIC OVERLAY (Dual Perspective)

```
Same death scene with dual annotation systems showing both perspectives: Central image: Person who has just died, lying peacefully in hospital bed. Body shown semi-transparent revealing both medical anatomy and energy systems. LEFT SIDE ANNOTATIONS (Medical/Western): - "Cardiac arrest - heart stopped" (pointing to heart) - "Cessation of brain activity" (pointing to brain) - "Respiratory failure - no breath" (pointing to lungs) - "Loss of consciousness" (pointing to head) - "Time of death: [timestamp]" - "Cause: [medical diagnosis]" - ECG monitor showing flatline - Medical equipment: ventilator off, IV drip, monitors all showing zeros - Doctor's note visible: "Patient expired at [time], all resuscitation efforts unsuccessful" - Medical perspective: "Death occurred suddenly when vital organs failed" RIGHT SIDE ANNOTATIONS (Vedic/Eastern): - "Atman (आत्मन्) departed 72 hours prior" (pointing to white light far above body) - "Internal sun (Bindu) extinguished 24 hours ago" (pointing to dark sphere at solar plexus) - "Prana (प्राण) exited through crown at last breath" (pointing to crown, showing blue-green wisp) - "All 72,000 Nadis now dark" (pointing to energy channel network) - "Seven chakras ceased spinning" (pointing to chakra locations) - "Five Koshas dissolved" (showing faint outlines of sheaths) - Vedic perspective: "Death is a 72-hour process. What medicine observes as 'sudden death' is the final collapse of systems that began shutting down days ago." CENTER RECONCILIATION: Arrow connecting both sides with text: "Same event, different observation levels. Medical science observes the frontend (physical effects). Vedic science understands the backend (consciousness process). Both are correct from their perspective." Bottom comparison table: | Medical View | Vedic View | |-------------|------------| | Heart stopped | Prana exited | | Brain dead | Atman departed | | No breath | Last exhalation released life force | | Sudden death | Final stage of 72-hour process | | Cause: organ failure | Cause: consciousness withdrawal | Caption: "Death: The gap between what we observe (frontend) and what actually occurs (backend)." Style: Educational medical chart meets spiritual diagram, professional dual-annotation system, clean modern design, respectful of both traditions, suitable for medical schools and spiritual teachings, integration of science and spirituality, 16:9, 8K.
