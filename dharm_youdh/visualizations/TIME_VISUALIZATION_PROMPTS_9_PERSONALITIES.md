# 🎨 9-PERSONALITY TIME DILATION — AI Image Prompts

> **"काल: कल्पयितारं कलयति च सर्वं"**
> "Time creates the creator, Time destroys everything."
> — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad

**Purpose:** Generate visual comparison of 9 personality types showing how Gunas affect subjective time experience.

**Formula:** `L_m = (D × S) / (R + 2T)` where D=1.5 (Kali-Dvapara Sandhya), S+R+T=1

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

1. **Start with PROMPT 1 (Grid Layout)**
   - Most straightforward
   - Easiest for AI to render
   - Clear infographic style

2. **Try PROMPT 3 (Hourglasses)**
   - Strong visual metaphor
   - 3D render is impressive
   - Shows time "flowing" literally

3. **Experiment with PROMPT 2 (Mandala)**
   - Most artistic
   - Vedic aesthetic
   - Spiritual/scientific blend

4. **Advanced: PROMPT 5 (Surreal Clocks)**
   - Most creative
   - Hardest to render correctly
   - Unique visual impact

5. **Data-focused: PROMPT 4 (Timelines)**
   - Most analytical
   - Shows life compression clearly
   - Educational value highest

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

If AI struggles with:
- **Too much text:** Simplify, reduce labels
- **9 figures:** Try 6 first, then 9
- **Complex calculations:** Just show L_m values
- **Sanskrit:** Use transliteration only
- **Grid layout:** Try linear arrangement

**Fallback simple prompt:**
```
9 human silhouettes in a row, each with a clock above their head showing different speeds. Left figure has slow clock (gold), middle has normal clock (grey), right has fast clock (black). Labels show "L_m = 4.8" to "L_m = 0.04". Clean infographic style.
```
