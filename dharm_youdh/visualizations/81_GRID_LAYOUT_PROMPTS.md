## Tips for Best Results

### For All AI Platforms:

**DO:**
✅ Specify exact square count (9, 16, 24, 32)  
✅ Mention "9×9 grid" explicitly  
✅ Describe each layer clearly  
✅ Use color coding for layers  
✅ Request "top-down view" or "bird's eye view"  
✅ Ask for "perfect symmetry"  
✅ Include "sacred geometry" for spiritual aesthetic  
✅ Specify aspect ratio 1:1 (square)  

**DON'T:**
❌ Be vague about structure  
❌ Mix too many styles in one prompt  
❌ Forget to specify the concentric layer structure  
❌ Use conflicting descriptors  

### Platform-Specific:

**Midjourney:**
- Use `--ar 1:1` for square format
- Add `--v 6` for latest model
- Use `--style raw` for more literal interpretation
- Try `--chaos 20` for artistic variation

**DALL-E 3:**
- Keep prompt under 400 words
- Be very specific about layout
- Mention "architectural diagram" for precision

**Stable Diffusion:**
- Use positive + negative prompts
- Negative: "blurry, distorted, asymmetric, messy"
- Try "sacred geometry" in positive prompt
