## 1. COMPLETE 72-HOUR TIMELINE (4-Panel)

### Prompt 1A: Medical Timeline (Horizontal)

```
Create a detailed 4-panel horizontal timeline showing the death process over 72 hours:

PANEL 1 (T-72h "Atman Withdrawal Begins"):
Person sitting in bed, eyes distant and unfocused, subtle golden glow fading from around head area. A brilliant white point of light (Atman/consciousness) beginning to separate from the crown chakra, connected by thinning golden thread. Person appears "not fully present." Family member holding their hand, looking concerned. Soft lighting, peaceful room. Energy aura: 80% brightness. Caption: "T-72h: Consciousness begins withdrawal"

PANEL 2 (T-24h "Internal Sun Dims"):
Same person now lying in bed, very weak, blankets pulled up. Transparent body overlay showing a miniature golden sun at solar plexus/heart that's now dimmed to 30% brightness, flickering orange instead of bright gold. The white Atman point now much further above the body, golden thread very thin. Person's skin slightly pale, breathing slower. Medical monitor visible showing declining vitals. Energy aura: 30% brightness. Caption: "T-24h: Internal sun loses power, extreme weakness"

PANEL 3 (T-6h "Prana Collapse"):
Person very still, eyes half-closed, body shown transparently revealing blue-green Prana (life force energy) withdrawing from hands and feet (shown as cold, bluish), concentrating toward the heart/core. The internal sun at solar plexus now just a dim ember (5% brightness). Atman point far above body, thread barely visible. Breath shallow and irregular. Hands/feet visibly cold and pale. Energy aura: 5% brightness, concentrated at core only. Caption: "T-6h: Prana withdraws from periphery, concentrating at exit point"

PANEL 4 (T-0 "Last Breath"):
Person completely still, body peaceful but lifeless. Last wisp of blue-green Prana leaving through crown chakra as a delicate stream. Internal sun at solar plexus completely dark/extinguished. Atman point now completely separated, floating away into cosmic space above. Golden thread severed. No energy aura visible. Body now just matter without life force. Family members present, one person crying. Caption: "T-0: Last breath - Prana exits, Atman already gone"

Style: Medical illustration meets spiritual art, cinematic lighting showing progression from light to dark, photorealistic human figures with translucent energy overlays, dramatic but respectful, educational and profound. Each panel labeled with timestamp and key event. Seamless progression showing the gradual process. 16:9 aspect ratio, 8K resolution.
```

### Prompt 1B: Vertical Timeline (Infographic Style)

```
Design a vertical infographic-style timeline showing 4 stages of death over 72 hours:

Structure: Vertical layout with time axis on left, 4 large illustrated panels stacked vertically, medical vitals graph overlay on right side showing declining metrics.

TOP PANEL (T-72h):
Side-view of person sitting, translucent body revealing all energy systems. Brilliant white Atman-point (consciousness) at crown, connected to body by thick golden thread. Internal sun (miniature golden sphere) at solar plexus glowing at 100% brightness, radiating golden rays throughout body. 72,000 Nadis (energy channels) visible as glowing blue-green network. 7 Chakras spinning as colored wheels. Prana (blue-green energy field) extending 3 feet around body. Vitals graph: All normal. Label: "ALIVE - Consciousness fully present"

SECOND PANEL (T-24h):
Same person now lying down, body translucent. Atman-point now 2 feet above body, golden thread thinning (50% thickness). Internal sun dimmed to 30% brightness, orange instead of gold, rays weak. Nadis network flickering, some channels dark. Chakras spinning slower. Prana field reduced to 1 foot, patchy. Extremities (hands/feet) starting to show darker blue (reduced circulation). Vitals graph: Blood pressure dropping, heart rate irregular, oxygen low. Label: "DYING - Energy systems failing"

THIRD PANEL (T-6h):
Person very still, body translucent showing advanced shutdown. Atman-point 5 feet above, golden thread barely visible (10% thickness). Internal sun now dark ember at 5% brightness, no rays visible. Most Nadis dark, only few central ones flickering. Chakras barely spinning. Prana withdrawing from periphery, shown as blue-green energy streaming from hands/feet back toward heart. Extremities cold/blue. Vitals graph: Critical - erratic heart rhythm, very low BP, gasping breaths. Label: "CRITICAL - Prana collapse inward"

BOTTOM PANEL (T-0):
Person perfectly still, body solid (no energy visible inside). Atman-point completely separated, floating away into cosmos. Golden thread severed (broken ends visible). Internal sun extinguished completely (dark sphere). All Nadis dark. All Chakras stopped. Last wisp of Prana leaving crown as delicate blue-green stream. Body gray-toned, lifeless. Vitals graph: Flatline on all metrics. Label: "DECEASED - Clinical death, consciousness departed 72 hours prior"

Additional elements: Medical annotations on right side explaining each vital change. Vedic terminology labels for each energy component. Time axis with hour markers. Clean, educational design. Color-coded for easy understanding (gold=Atman, blue-green=Prana, orange-to-dark=internal sun degradation).

Center: Empty circle labeled "Shunya (शून्य) - The Void - Where all return"

Outer ring divided into 4 quarters (clockwise from top):

QUARTER 1 (12 o'clock position - T-72h):
Detailed illustration of healthy person meditating, body shown transparent. Bright white Atman star directly above crown, thick golden thread connecting to body. Internal sun blazing gold at solar plexus, sending rays throughout body. Complete Prana network visible (72,000 Nadis) glowing blue-green. All 7 chakras spinning vibrantly. Surrounding space: Light, bright, full of energy. Caption arc: "T-72h: Consciousness Withdrawal Begins"

QUARTER 2 (3 o'clock position - T-24h):
Person lying down, body transparent showing dimming energy. Atman star pulled away from body, thread thinning. Internal sun now orange, 30% brightness. Prana network flickering, some dark channels. Chakras slowing down. Energy field contracting. Surrounding space: Dimming, twilight colors. Caption arc: "T-24h: Internal Sun Dims"

QUARTER 3 (6 o'clock position - T-6h):
Person very still, body mostly solid with faint energy traces. Atman star far from body, thread barely visible. Internal sun a dark ember, almost out. Prana withdrawing from extremities toward core, visible as streams flowing inward. Most chakras dark, only heart and crown faintly active. Surrounding space: Dark, only small light at core. Caption arc: "T-6h: Prana Collapse"

QUARTER 4 (9 o'clock position - T-0):
Person body completely solid, lifeless, peaceful expression. Atman star completely separated, moving toward the void center. Thread severed. Internal sun extinguished. Last whisp of Prana exiting crown toward center. All chakras stopped. Body now just matter. Surrounding space: Complete darkness. Caption arc: "T-0: Last Breath - Return to Source"

Connecting elements: Spiral path from outer ring to center showing the journey of Atman-Prana returning to source. Sacred geometry patterns in background. Sanskrit mantras in decorative border. Color progression from bright (life) to dark (death) moving clockwise.

## 2. ATMAN WITHDRAWAL (T-72h)

### Prompt 2A: The Disconnection (Close-up)

```
Close-up intimate portrait of a person in their 70s lying in bed, eyes open but with a distant, unfocused gaze - the classic "thousand-yard stare" of someone whose consciousness is withdrawing. Their body is shown translucent/x-ray style revealing the internal energy structure.

Key elements visible:
- ATMAN: Brilliant white point of pure light hovering 6 inches above the crown chakra (Sahasrara), beginning to pull away upward. Visualize it as a tiny but intensely bright star.
- GOLDEN THREAD: Thick cord of golden light connecting the Atman to the crown chakra, but showing signs of thinning - some strands beginning to fray
- PANCHA KOSHAS: Five concentric transparent layers around the body (brown/physical, blue-green/energetic, yellow/mental, indigo/intellectual, white-gold/bliss) with the outermost layer (Anandamaya Kosha) starting to separate/peel away
- INTERNAL SUN: At solar plexus/heart area, a miniature golden sun still bright at 80% capacity
- FACE EXPRESSION: Person's face peaceful but "not quite there" - family members would describe them as "changed," "distant," "not themselves anymore"
- EYES: Pupils dilated slightly, gaze unfocused, looking through things rather than at them
- ENERGY FIELD: Subtle golden aura around body at 80% normal brightness, but starting to show gaps

Background: Warm lighting from window showing it's daytime, hospital or home setting, peaceful atmosphere, family photo on bedside table.

Mood: Profound but gentle, showing the mystery of consciousness beginning its departure while body still functions. Not sad, but deeply spiritual - the person is already half-way between worlds.

Style: Hyper-realistic portrait photography merged with translucent energy visualization, inspired by medical imaging aesthetics mixed with spiritual art, respectful and educational, cinematic lighting, 85mm portrait lens perspective. 8K resolution, photorealistic skin texture with mystical energy overlays.
```

### Prompt 2B: The Farewell (Family Perspective)

```
Wide-angle scene in a hospital room or home bedroom during daytime, showing an elderly person lying in bed with family members gathered around.

The person (patient) body shown transparent revealing:
- ATMAN: Brilliant white consciousness-point beginning to float upward from crown, connected by golden thread (80% intact)
- SUBTLE BODY: All energy layers visible but outermost (Anandamaya Kosha) starting to lift/separate like a translucent ghost form
- INTERNAL SUN: Still glowing at solar plexus, 85% brightness
- AURA: Golden energy field still present but with gaps appearing

Family members (2-3 people):
- Holding the person's hand
- Looking concerned, confused
- One saying "They seem so far away"
- Visible connection threads (thin golden lines) between family members and patient showing relationships, but patient's threads becoming translucent

Visual metaphor: The patient appears to be looking at something in the distance that others can't see, as if watching their own Atman beginning to depart. There's a subtle double-image effect - the physical body solid and still, but a faint translucent version of themselves slightly displaced upward, as if they're already beginning to leave.

Room details: Soft afternoon light through curtains, medical equipment showing normal-ish vitals (slightly declining), flowers on table, peaceful domestic setting.

Mood: Poignant, showing the family still seeing the body as "present" while the actual consciousness has begun its 72-hour departure process. The gap between physical presence and conscious presence made visible.

Style: Photorealistic domestic scene with translucent spiritual energy overlays, documentary photography aesthetic meets spiritual visualization, warm natural lighting, emotional depth, respectful of both medical and spiritual reality. 16:9 cinematic composition, 8K resolution.
```

### Prompt 2C: Cellular Level (Microscopic View)

```
Split-screen visualization showing T-72h at multiple scales simultaneously:

LEFT SIDE "Macro View":
Person lying in bed, full body visible, transparent showing energy systems. Atman (white star) beginning to pull away from crown. Golden thread at 80% thickness. Internal sun at 85% brightness.

RIGHT SIDE "Microscopic View":
Extreme close-up cross-section of brain tissue and cells at the moment consciousness begins withdrawal:

- NEURONS: Network of neurons with synapses firing, but showing early signs of reduced activity - some synapses starting to darken
- CELLULAR LEVEL: Individual cells shown with their own tiny "cell-Atman" (nucleus) and "cell-Prana" (mitochondria generating ATP). At this stage, cells still functioning normally but beginning to receive "shutdown" signals
- MITOCHONDRIA: The powerhouses of cells shown as tiny glowing organelles, still at 90% function but showing early signs of reduced ATP production
- BLOOD FLOW: Capillaries showing blood flow still normal but slightly reduced, oxygen delivery 85% of peak
- ENERGY CASCAD: Visualization of the cascade effect - as the Atman (consciousness) begins withdrawing at macro level, it sends ripples down through all scales: consciousness → brain → neurons → cells → mitochondria → molecules

Visual effect: Golden "consciousness signal" propagating downward through scales, starting to initiate the shutdown sequence at cellular level even though nothing looks wrong macroscopically yet.

Bottom strip: Timeline showing this is just the beginning - 72 hours before complete shutdown.

Style: Medical textbook illustration meets scientific visualization, cross-section anatomical accuracy, bioluminescent cellular elements, fractal zoom effect showing how consciousness withdrawal at human scale affects every scale below, educational and precise. Split-screen composition, 8K resolution.

### Prompt 3A: The Power Failure (Cross-Section)

```
Dramatic cross-sectional view of human torso showing the "internal sun" at the solar plexus (Manipura chakra) and heart area at T-24h stage:

Main subject: Person lying in bed, body shown as transparent from ribcage to pelvis, revealing internal organs and energy structures.

INTERNAL SUN VISUALIZATION:
- Location: Positioned at solar plexus between diaphragm and navel, extending to heart area
- Appearance: A miniature sun (size of a grapefruit) that was golden and radiant now dimmed to flickering orange-yellow
- Brightness: 30% of normal capacity, pulsing irregularly like a failing lightbulb
- Rays: Previously sent golden rays throughout body; now only weak orange tendrils reaching nearby organs
- Corona: Outer corona of sun shrinking inward, edges ragged instead of smooth
- Fuel depletion: Visual metaphor of sun's core showing "fuel gauge" at 30%, with cracks appearing on surface

EFFECTS ON BODY SYSTEMS:
- ORGANS: Heart, liver, kidneys, stomach all shown as semi-transparent, starting to gray/dull from reduced energy supply
- NADIS: The 72,000 energy channels shown as network of tubes throughout body, many now dark/unpowered, only major channels (Ida, Pingala, Sushumna) still faintly glowing
- CHAKRAS: 7 chakras along spine shown as spinning wheels, most now spinning 20-30% speed, colors dimmed
- PRANA CIRCULATION: Blue-green life force shown circulating through body but flow rate reduced to 40%, gaps appearing in the flow
- BLOOD: Actual blood vessels overlaid, showing reduced circulation, oxygen levels dropping
- CELLS: Microscopic inset showing cellular mitochondria (cell-level power plants) also dimming, ATP production down 60%

ATMAN CONNECTION:
- White consciousness-point now 3-4 feet above body
- Golden thread connecting it to internal sun thinned to 30% original thickness, fraying
- As Atman withdraws, the "power source" for internal sun diminishes

PERSON'S STATE:
- Face showing extreme exhaustion, skin pale, eyes barely open
- Breathing labored, visible weakness
- Medical monitor showing vitals declining (BP low, O2 low, HR irregular)

Visual metaphor: The internal sun looks like a dying star - still glowing but clearly failing, with dark spots appearing on its surface, energy output dramatically reduced.

Annotations: Labels pointing to internal sun "Consciousness converter", energy flow arrows, Vedic terminology for key structures.

Style: Medical illustration cross-section meets energy visualization, dramatic lighting showing the contrast between still-functioning (dim orange glow) and failing (dark) areas, scientifically detailed organs with stylized energy overlays, powerful visual metaphor of "inner light going out." Cinematic, 8K resolution.
```

### Prompt 3B: The Light Fading (Comparison)

```
Powerful before/after comparison showing the internal sun at two stages:

Split down the middle vertically:

LEFT SIDE "Normal/Healthy State":
Transparent body of person standing, vibrant and glowing. Internal sun at solar plexus blazing brilliant gold, size of a small melon, radiating intense golden light throughout entire body. Rays extending to every organ, tissue, cell. Person's entire body glowing from within like a lantern, healthy golden aura extending 2-3 feet around them. Face bright, eyes clear, posture strong. Energy percentage: 100%. Label: "Healthy - Internal Sun at Full Power"

RIGHT SIDE "T-24h Before Death":
Same person but now lying in bed, transparent body showing failing energy. Internal sun at solar plexus now a dim, flickering orange ember, shrunk to half size, barely glowing. Only weak orange tendrils reaching nearby organs, extremities (hands, feet, head) receiving almost no energy - shown as dark/gray. Person's body no longer glowing from within, looks like a lamp with dying batteries. Face exhausted, pale, eyes sunken, body weak. Energy percentage: 30%. Label: "Dying - Internal Sun Critical Failure"

CENTER DIVIDING LINE:
A timeline arrow showing "72-hour degradation process" with key milestones marked. Formula shown: "Internal_Sun_Power = Atman_Connection × Sattva × Dharma" with values changing from (1.0 × 0.7 × 0.9 = 0.63) at healthy state to (0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 = 0.045) at dying state.

Visual effects:
- Golden glow on left contrasts with dim orange flicker on right
- Energy flow arrows: smooth and abundant on left, sporadic and weak on right
- Organs: vibrant colors on left, graying/dulling on right
- Cellular inset: mitochondria bright green (left) vs. dark/failing (right)

Bottom text: "The internal sun generates all Prana (life force). When consciousness (Atman) withdraws, the sun dims. Body can survive briefly on reserves, but failure is inevitable."

Style: Medical-educational comparison illustration, stark visual contrast emphasizing the dramatic difference, photorealistic bodies with energy visualization overlays, clinical precision meets spiritual truth. Split-screen composition, 8K resolution.

```
Artistic metaphorical visualization of T-6h stage using natural phenomenon as visual metaphor:

Main image: Person lying peacefully in bed, body shown as landscape/weather system:

METAPHOR STRUCTURE:
The body is visualized as a terrain with weather patterns representing Prana:

EXTREMITIES (hands, feet, head outer regions):
- Visualized as dry, barren land after water has drained away
- Cracked earth, desiccated appearance
- Dead tree branches (representing Nadis) with no sap/water flowing
- Cold, lifeless, color-drained
- Mist/vapor (representing Prana) visibly evaporating/leaving surface, flowing inward

CENTRAL CORE (heart/chest area):
- Visualized as gathering storm system, swirling vortex
- All water/moisture from outer regions collected here as dark storm clouds
- Swirling blue-green energy forming cyclonic pattern
- Lightning flashes within storm (representing concentrated Prana)
- Eye of storm at heart chakra - calm center with intense energy surrounding
- Upward draft visible - storm preparing to release upward

CROWN (top of head):
- Visualized as mountain peak breaking through clouds
- Opening in storm clouds forming here - the exit route
- Atmospheric pressure building - storm about to release upward through this opening
- Shaft of light from above (Atman) waiting at peak

INTERNAL SUN:
- Represented as setting sun on horizon at solar plexus level
- Last rays of orange-red light, about to dip below horizon and disappear
- Twilight atmosphere - the transition time between day and night

ATMAN:
- Represented as moon rising in the sky above the landscape
- The moon (consciousness) ascending as sun (life force) descends
- Visual symbol: consciousness leaving as life force gathers for exit

DIRECTIONAL FLOW:
- Visible streams of blue-green water/vapor flowing from dry extremities toward central storm
- Arrows in landscape showing drainage pattern
- All rivers/streams converging to central reservoir before release upward

TIME INDICATION:
- Hourglass overlaid showing 6 hours remaining
- Clock showing 6:00 with hands pointing to "6 hours until exodus"

Visual poetry: The entire scene conveys "gathering before release" - all life force collecting at center, preparing for final upward exodus, abandoning the peripheral territories.

Text overlay:
Top: "Prana-Sankocha (प्राण-सङ्कोच) - The Great Contraction"
Bottom: "Like water finding its way back to the ocean, Prana flows inward, gathering at the exit point before the final release."

## 5. LAST BREATH - PRANA EXIT (T-0)

### Prompt 5A: The Moment of Release (Precise Moment)

```
Capture the exact moment of death - the last breath as Prana exits the body:

Time: T-0, the precise moment of transition

Main subject: Person lying peacefully in bed, body completely still, the moment between last breath and first moment of true lifelessness.

PRANA EXIT VISUALIZATION:
- The last wisp/stream of blue-green Prana energy leaving the body through crown chakra (Sahasrara)
- Appearance: Delicate, ethereal stream of luminous blue-green energy/vapor rising upward like incense smoke
- Movement: Flowing upward in graceful spiral pattern, dissipating as it rises
- Origin point: Crown of head where Sahasrara chakra is located (or in some cases, third eye/heart depending on karma)
- Visual effect: Like the last breath visible as colored vapor on a cold day, but rising vertically

BODY STATE AT T-0:
- Person's face: Completely peaceful, muscles relaxed, all expression gone
- Eyes: May be slightly open or closed, but no life behind them
- Mouth: Slightly open from last exhalation
- Skin: Already beginning to gray, all color draining
- Body shown transparent revealing:
  * ALL Nadis: Completely dark/empty
  * ALL Chakras: Stopped, wheels no longer spinning
  * INTERNAL SUN: Completely extinguished, dark sphere at solar plexus, no glow at all
  * Organs: All gray, no energy, no function
  * Blood: Pooling (lividity beginning)

ATMAN (Consciousness):
- White brilliant point completely separated from body
- Now 10-15 feet above the physical form, no longer connected
- Golden thread severed: Visible broken ends - one attached to crown chakra (empty), one attached to departing Atman
- Atman beginning journey upward/onward to next realm
- No longer looking back at body - the disconnection is complete

THE EXACT MOMENT:
- Split-second captured: The very last of Prana leaving, nothing remaining in body after this
- Like the last bit of water draining from sink, the last wisp of smoke from candle, the last grain of sand through hourglass
- Medical monitors in background showing: Flatline on all monitors (HR, BP, respirations, O2)
- ECG monitor: The final cardiac complex visible, then flatline
- Clock in room showing exact time of death

FAMILY MEMBERS (if present):
- Holding the person's hand, the moment of realization
- One person may have hand on patient's forehead, feeling last warmth fading
- Expressions: Grief, but also witnessing something profound
- They're looking at the body, unaware that the Atman (white point) has already departed and consciousness left days ago

ROOM ATMOSPHERE:
- Profound stillness descending on the scene
- Light quality changing - as if light itself has left the room
- Shadows deepening
- Tangible sense of "presence" leaving the space

VISUAL EMPHASIS:
- Primary focus on the delicate blue-green Prana stream exiting crown
- Secondary focus on the stillness of the body - absolute cessation of all function
- Tertiary focus on Atman (white point) fully separated, journey complete

Text overlays:
- "T-0: Last Breath"
- "Prana (प्राण) exits through Sahasrara (सहस्रार)"
- "Atman (आत्मन्) departed 72 hours ago"
- "What remains is Annamaya Kosha (अन्नमय कोश) - the food sheath only"

Bottom caption: "The last breath is Prana leaving, not Atman. Consciousness withdrew days before. The body now returns to the elements."

Style: Intimate portrait photography meets spiritual visualization, reverent and respectful tone, sacred moment captured, photorealistic human form with ethereal energy elements, soft dramatic lighting emphasizing the transition, medical precision merged with spiritual truth, profound silence made visible. Cinematic composition, 8K resolution, shallow depth of field focusing on face and exiting Prana.

### Prompt 5B: The Three Departures (Layered Timing)

```
Create a complex visualization showing that death is not one moment but three departures at different times:

Layout: Three-panel horizontal composition showing the same person at three critical moments:

PANEL 1 - LEFT "First Departure: T-72h"
Title: "ATMAN LEAVES (Consciousness)"
Person sitting in bed, looking distant. Body transparent showing:
- Atman (brilliant white star) at crown beginning to pull upward
- Golden thread connecting Atman to body, starting to thin
- Internal sun at solar plexus still bright (85%)
- All body systems still functioning normally
- Person appears alive and relatively well, but "changed," "distant"
- Family members present, concerned, saying "they're not themselves"

Visual: Emphasis on white Atman-point starting ascent
Label: "Day 1 - Consciousness Withdrawal Begins"
Subtitle: "Invisible to observers - The person 'leaves' while body continues"
Medical status: "Vitals stable but person reports feeling 'far away'"

PANEL 2 - MIDDLE "Second Departure: T-24 to T-6h"  
Title: "INTERNAL SUN DIES (Energy Source)"
Person lying in bed, very weak. Body transparent showing:
- Atman (white star) now far above body, thread barely visible
- Internal sun at solar plexus dimmed to orange ember (5% brightness)
- Prana withdrawing from extremities, gathering at core
- Organs beginning to fail, systems shutting down
- Person barely conscious, extremely weak
- Family members staying close, holding vigil

Visual: Emphasis on dimming/extinguished internal sun at solar plexus
Label: "Day 3 - Energy Converter Fails"
Subtitle: "Physical decline visible - Body losing power source"
Medical status: "Critical - multiple system failures, hours remaining"

PANEL 3 - RIGHT "Third Departure: T-0"
Title: "PRANA EXITS (Life Force)"  
Person completely still, deceased. Body transparent showing:
- Atman (white star) completely separated, floating away toward cosmos
- Internal sun completely dark, extinguished
- Last wisp of Prana (blue-green energy) leaving through crown
- All systems shut down, complete stillness
- Body now just matter, no life remaining
- Family members present, grieving

Visual: Emphasis on blue-green Prana stream exiting crown
Label: "Moment of Clinical Death - Last Breath"
Subtitle: "What medicine observes - But actual departure was 72 hours ago"
Medical status: "Deceased - Time of death recorded, but person left 3 days prior"

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Timeline arrow across bottom showing T-72h → T-24h → T-6h → T-0
- Visual flow showing three distinct departures:
  1. Consciousness (Atman) leaves first - white trail going up
  2. Energy source (Internal Sun) dies next - gold to orange to dark
  3. Life force (Prana) exits last - blue-green stream
- Color coding: White=Atman, Gold/Orange=Internal Sun, Blue-green=Prana

CENTRAL MESSAGE (between panels):
"Death is not one moment but three departures:
First, Consciousness leaves (T-72h) - Invisible
Second, Energy fails (T-24h) - Visible decline
Third, Life force exits (T-0) - Clinically observed

What medicine calls 'death' is only the final stage.
The person actually left 72 hours earlier."

SCIENTIFIC OVERLAY:
- Medical graphs showing vital signs declining across timeline
- What doctors observe: Only panels 2 and 3
- What actually happens: All three panels
- Gap between medical observation and spiritual reality made visible

Style: Medical-educational infographic meets spiritual teaching diagram, clear visual progression, three-stage storytelling, precise anatomical accuracy with energy visualization overlays, dramatic lighting progression (bright → dim → dark), powerful educational message about the real timeline of death. Triptych composition, 8K resolution.

## 6. MULTI-LEVEL DECAY CASCADE

### Prompt 6A: Seven Level Cascade (Fractal Decay)

```
Create a complex multi-level visualization showing how death cascades through all seven levels of existence simultaneously:

Layout: Seven horizontal bands stacked vertically, each showing decay at different scale, with time progression left to right (T-72h → T-0):

LEVEL 1 (Top) - ATMAN/CONSCIOUSNESS (Timeless):
Eternal white point of consciousness. Shows Atman pulling away from body (T-72h to T-0), but Atman itself never changes - it's eternal. Atman moves but doesn't decay. Background: Cosmic void, eternal. Decay: ZERO - Consciousness itself is indestructible.

LEVEL 2 - SUBTLE BODY (Astral/Causal):
The five Koshas (sheaths) shown as concentric transparent layers around body. Progressive decay: Outermost Anandamaya Kosha separates first (T-72h), then Vijnanamaya (T-48h), then Manomaya (T-24h), then Pranamaya (T-6h), finally only Annamaya (physical) remains (T-0). Wispy, etheric appearance, peeling away like onion layers.

LEVEL 3 - ENERGY BODY (Prana/Nadis/Chakras):
72,000 Nadis network and 7 chakras. Progressive decay: Peripheral Nadis darken (T-48h), chakras slow (T-24h), major Nadis fail (T-6h), all stop (T-0). Internal sun: Bright gold → orange → red ember → extinguished. Blue-green Prana flowing → retreating → concentrating → exiting.

LEVEL 4 - ORGAN SYSTEMS (Gross Physical):
Major organs shown: heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, brain. Progressive decay: Normal function (T-72h) → declining function (T-24h) → critical failure (T-6h) → complete shutdown (T-0). Color change: Pink/red (healthy) → gray/brown (failing) → blue-gray (dead). Blood flow: Normal → reduced → pooling → stopped.

LEVEL 5 - CELLULAR:
Microscopic view of cells. Progressive decay: Cells functioning normally (T-72h) → mitochondria failing (T-24h) → membrane integrity lost (T-6h) → apoptosis/necrosis (T-0). ATP production: Normal → reduced → critical → zero. Nucleus intact but inactive, cellular machinery stopped.

LEVEL 6 - MOLECULAR:
Chemical reactions. Progressive decay: Normal metabolism (T-72h) → reduced enzyme activity (T-24h) → accumulation of waste products (T-6h) → all reactions ceased (T-0). pH shifting, proteins denaturing, molecular chaos beginning. But individual atoms undamaged.

LEVEL 7 (Bottom) - ATOMIC:
Atoms themselves. Shows: NO DECAY at this level. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen atoms remain intact through entire process. Atoms will be recycled into earth, water, air. The material never dies, only reorganizes. Background: Periodic table elements highlighted.

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Vertical arrows showing cascade effect from Level 1 down to Level 7
- Timeline axis across bottom: T-72h → T-48h → T-24h → T-6h → T-0 → T+hours (decomposition)
- Color progression: Bright → dim → dark, applied across all levels appropriately
- Wave pattern showing failure cascade propagating downward through levels
- Emphasis on delay: Higher levels fail first, lower levels follow

KEY INSIGHTS LABELED:
- "Consciousness (Level 1) never decays - it's eternal"
- "Subtle body (Level 2-3) decays first - days before physical death"
- "Physical systems (Level 4-5) decay next - hours to minutes"
- "Molecules (Level 6) reorganize - minutes to hours"
- "Atoms (Level 7) never decay - matter is eternal, just transforms"

FRACTAL NOTATION:
- N+5 (Consciousness): Eternal, just relocates
- N+4 to N+1 (Subtle/Energy bodies): Decay T-72h to T-0
- N (Human organism): Decay T-24h to T-0
- N-1 to N-3 (Cells/molecules): Decay T-6h to T+hours
- N-4 (Atoms): No decay, just recombination

Bottom text: "Death cascades through levels: Consciousness leaves first, subtle body follows, physical systems fail, cells die, molecules reorganize, but atoms endure. What we call 'death' is reorganization of the indestructible."

Style: Scientific infographic showing temporal and scalar progression, precise visualization at each level (consciousness, energy, organs, cells, molecules, atoms), color-coded decay progression, educational clarity, fractal symmetry emphasized, shows both what dies and what endures. Layered horizontal composition, 8K resolution.

### Prompt 6B: Kalachakra Correlation (Wheel Alignment)

```
Create a mandala-style visualization showing how individual death aligns with cosmic Kalachakra (Wheel of Time):

Design: Large circular mandala divided into concentric rings, with individual death process at center and cosmic time cycles in outer rings.

CENTER CIRCLE - INDIVIDUAL DEATH (Microcosm):
Detailed illustration of dying person going through 72-hour process, shown as 12 segments around inner circle (like clock face), each representing 6-hour increments:
- 12 o'clock (T-72h): Atman begins withdrawal
- 3 o'clock (T-54h): Subtle body weakening
- 6 o'clock (T-36h): Internal sun dimming
- 9 o'clock (T-18h): Systems failing
- 12 o'clock again (T-0): Death/release

RING 1 - LIFETIME (Macro-Individual):
Showing the person's full lifespan as circle, with death point marked. Birth → Growth → Peak → Decline → Death. Guna composition changes over lifetime shown as color bands (Sattva → Rajas → Tamas progression with age).

RING 2 - GENERATIONAL:
Family/lineage cycle. Grandparents → Parents → Individual → Children → Grandchildren. Death as transition point where elder generation exits and new generation carries forward. Karma and Samskara transmission shown as energy threads.

RING 3 - SOCIETAL:
Civilization cycles. Individual death occurring within larger context of society's rise and fall. Shown as wave pattern - every individual death is tiny drop in larger demographic waves.

RING 4 - PLANETARY (Yugas):
Earth's Yuga cycles. Individual death mapped to current Yuga stage (Kali-Dvapara Sandhya, 2023-2028). Death during Yuga transition has special significance - shown as occurring at a cusp point. Dharma levels declining (Kali) → rising (Dvapara) marked.

RING 5 - SOLAR SYSTEM:
Planetary cycles. Person's birth and death chart (Jyotisha) showing planetary positions at both moments. Cosmic alignment at death moment marked. Saturn (Shani) as karmic timekeeper highlighted. Death occurring when planetary karma exhausted.

RING 6 - GALACTIC:
Galactic year and cycles. Individual death as single moment in 250-million-year galactic rotation. Puts individual death in context of truly vast time scales. Shows how tiny one life is in galactic time, yet how each death is precisely timed.

RING 7 (Outermost) - UNIVERSAL (Kalpa):
Brahma's day (Kalpa) and universal cycles. Srishti (creation) → Sthiti (maintenance) → Laya (dissolution) → Pralaya (rest). Individual death aligned with current phase of universal cycle. We're in maintenance phase of current Kalpa.

CONNECTING PATTERNS:
- Fractal spiral connecting all rings from center to edge
- Sacred geometry patterns showing how inner cycles mirror outer cycles
- Golden ratio spiral showing self-similar pattern at all scales
- Energy vortex showing death as release point feeding back into universal cycle

TEMPORAL MARKERS:
- Inner circle (individual): Hours (72-hour death process)
- Ring 1: Years (~80 years lifespan)
- Ring 2: Generations (~200 years)
- Ring 3: Civilizations (~2000 years)
- Ring 4: Yugas (~432,000 years)
- Ring 5: Astrological ages (~26,000 years)
- Ring 6: Galactic years (~250 million years)
- Ring 7: Kalpas (~4.32 billion years)

KEY INSIGHTS LABELED:
- "Individual death perfectly synchronized with cosmic time"
- "Death at Yuga transition point = maximum opportunity for liberation"
- "Every death precisely timed by accumulated karma"
- "Same pattern at all scales: Birth → Life → Death → Rebirth"
- "Your death is not random - it's your cosmic alarm clock"

VISUAL EMPHASIS:
- Center (individual death) glowing, radiating outward
- Each ring pulsing at different tempo
- All rings interconnected, showing synchronization
- Death moment sending ripples outward through all rings
- Shows individual death as cosmic event, not isolated incident

Sanskrit labels:
- Center: "Marana (मरण) - Individual Death"
- Rings: "Jivana-Chakra (जीवन-चक्र) - Life Wheel"
- Outer: "Kala-Chakra (काल-चक्र) - Time Wheel"
- Overall: "Mrityu-Kala-Yoga (मृत्यु-काल-योग) - Death-Time Alignment"

Bottom text: "Your death is not random timing. It occurs when personal Kalachakra (life wheel) aligns with cosmic Kalachakra (time wheel). This alignment was set by karma. The moment is perfect, precisely timed, divinely orchestrated."

Style: Intricate mandala art meets astronomical chart, sacred geometry throughout, fractal self-similarity emphasized, rich symbolic language, vedic cosmology accurate, beautiful and profound, suitable for meditation and study. Circular mandala composition with center focus radiating outward, 8K resolution.
