## 📱 QUICK TIPS

### For Best Results:
1. **Start with Prompt 1** (Grid) - easiest for AI
2. **Use Midjourney v6** for best quality
3. **Add `--ar 16:9`** for wide format
4. **Add `--v 6`** for latest version
5. **Add `--style raw`** for less interpretation

### If AI Struggles:
- Simplify: Remove some text labels
- Try 6 figures first, then 9
- Focus on visual metaphor, less calculation
- Use color coding more than numbers

### Platform-Specific:
- **Midjourney:** Best for artistic prompts (2, 5)
- **DALL-E 3:** Best for infographics (1, 4)
- **Stable Diffusion:** Best for 3D renders (3)
- **Leonardo AI:** Good balance for all

## ⚡ ULTRA-SIMPLE FALLBACK

If complex prompts fail, use this:

```
Simple infographic: 9 human silhouettes in a row. Left figure glowing gold with text "L_m=4.8, 480% time depth", middle figure grey "L_m=0.27, 27% time depth", right figure dark "L_m=0.04, 4% time depth". Gradient from gold to black. Clock symbols above each head showing different speeds. Formula at top: L_m = (D × S) / (R + 2T). Clean professional style --ar 16:9 --v 6
```
