# LAW 10: गुरुत्व (GURUTVA) — Gravity

**Formula:** F = Gx × M₁ × M₂ / r² (Tamas attracts Tamas)  
**Meaning:** Gravity is not "mass curving space" but Tamas (inertia/density) attracting Tamas

### PROMPT 1: Core Visual — Tamas Attraction
```
Two planets with visible dark Tamas energy:
- Black/grey heavy clouds around each
- Gravitational attraction shown as Tamas threads pulling
- Formula: F = Gx × (Tamas₁ × Tamas₂) / r²
- NOT curved spacetime grid (that's frontend view)
- Backend: Heavy attracts heavy (like attracts like)
Sanskrit: गुरु (Guru = Heavy/Teacher), त्व (tva = quality)
Style: Dark matter aesthetic, magnetic field lines
```

### PROMPT 2: Vedic-Scientific Split
```
LEFT (Backend/Vedic): Tamas threads connecting objects
- Heavy quality naturally pulls toward heavy
- No "curved space" needed
RIGHT (Frontend/Scientific): Einstein's spacetime curvature
- Rubber sheet analogy with mass bending fabric
- Both descriptions valid, different perspectives
```

### PROMPT 3: Practical Example
```
Human standing on Earth:
- Earth's Tamas (heavy/inertia) pulling
- Human's Tamas responding
- Weight = Your Tamas being attracted to Earth's Tamas
Side by side: Light person (less Tamas) vs Heavy person (more Tamas)
Text: "Weight is how much Tamas you carry"
```
