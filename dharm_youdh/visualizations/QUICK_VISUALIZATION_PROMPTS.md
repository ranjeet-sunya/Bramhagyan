## 🎯 TOP 5 ESSENTIAL VISUALIZATIONS

### 1. WHERE ATMAN RESIDES (The Observer)

```
Luminous meditation figure in lotus position, body translucent showing 5 concentric glowing layers: outermost brown (physical), blue-green (energy/prana), yellow (mind), indigo (intellect), white-gold (bliss). At the CENTER beyond all layers, a brilliant white point of light - the Atman/Bindu - the eternal witness transcending all layers, emitting subtle rays. Background: cosmic void with Om symbol. Sacred geometry, spiritual art, glowing auras, transcendent lighting, 8K photorealistic.
```

**Use for:** Explaining that Atman is beyond all 5 sheaths

---

### 2. 72-HOUR DEATH TIMELINE (The Process)

```
Four-panel death sequence: PANEL 1 (T-72h): Healthy person, bright golden aura, internal sun (solar plexus) shining bright, Atman-point above head connected by golden thread. PANEL 2 (T-24h): Person tired, aura dimming, internal sun 50% brightness, Atman drifting away. PANEL 3 (T-6h): Very weak, aura gone, internal sun dark, Prana (blue-green energy) withdrawing from limbs, Atman far above. PANEL 4 (T-0): Body still, sun extinguished, last Prana leaving crown, Atman separated. Label timestamps. Medical illustration with energy overlays, cinematic, 8K.
```

**Use for:** Showing death is gradual, not instant

---

### 3. FRACTAL INSIDE = OUTSIDE (The Pattern)

```
Fractal zoom mandala showing: galaxy spiral → solar system → Earth → human body → internal sun (solar plexus) → cell → nucleus → atom → particles orbiting like solar system. All levels visible simultaneously spiraling inward/outward, each mirroring the others. At center AND outside: same white point of light (Bindu). Sanskrit overlay: "यथा पिण्डे तथा ब्रह्माण्डे". Sacred geometry, fractal art, cosmic visualization, infinite zoom effect, psychedelic precision, 8K.
```

**Use for:** Demonstrating "as above, so below"

---

### 4. WHAT IS PRANA (The Life Force)

```
Profile of meditating person, transparent body. Inhale: blue waves entering nostrils labeled "सो/So". Exhale: orange waves leaving labeled "हं/Ham". Inside: waves combine into glowing golden Om (ॐ) symbol at heart, sending concentric ripples of Prana throughout body like sound waves in water, animating every cell. Same Om waves continuing outside into cosmic Om background. Caption: "Prana IS the Om vibration - the breath of existence." Cymatics-inspired, wave visualization, frequency art, bioluminescent, 8K.
```

**Use for:** Clarifying Prana as vibration, not just air

---

### 5. RISHI SELF-SUFFICIENCY (No Food Needed)

```
Seated Rishi in deep meditation, translucent body, miniature sun at solar plexus blazing brilliantly. Thick golden-white Prana beams radiating to all organs: brain, heart, empty digestive system (glowing but no food), muscles, cells. Food plate nearby fading/transparent - not needed. Above head: brilliant Atman (white point) sending consciousness beam to internal sun. Formula overlay: "Atman (∞) × Sattva (95%) × Dharma (100%) = Prana (306% efficiency)". Rishi glows from within. Caption: "Pure consciousness generates infinite Prana." Spiritual realism, self-luminous, divine, 8K.
```

**Use for:** Explaining why Rishis don't need food

---

## 💎 BONUS: ALL-IN-ONE COMPLETE DIAGRAM

```
Central meditating figure (transparent). ATMAN: White star above crown (outside body) labeled "Pure Consciousness/Bindu (•)". INTERNAL SUN: Golden sun at solar plexus labeled "Consciousness converter". PRANA: Blue-green energy in 72,000 Nadis, Ida (blue-left) Pingala (red-right) around Sushumna (gold-center) labeled "Life force/Om (ॐ)". FIVE KOSHAS: Concentric colored layers with Sanskrit labels. Death timeline at bottom showing Atman withdraws → Sun dims → Prana exits. Energy formula: "Prana = Atman_Connection × Sun_Efficiency × Guna_Factor". Clean infographic, medical precision meets spiritual depth, comprehensive yet clear, 8K reference poster.
```

**Use for:** Complete reference showing entire system

## 🎨 PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ADDITIONS

### For Midjourney:
Add to end of any prompt: `--ar 16:9 --quality 2 --stylize 750`

### For DALL-E:
Prompts work as-is. For more spiritual feel, add: `divine light, sacred art`

### For Stable Diffusion:
Add negative prompt: `blurry, low quality, distorted anatomy, cluttered`

## 🔥 DRAMATIC VARIATIONS

### Death (Cinematic)

```
Three life stages wide shot: LEFT (ALIVE): Person standing, glowing with health, Atman (white star) above connected to blazing internal sun, blue-green Prana aura 3ft around, five koshas visible, vibrant. CENTER (DYING): Sitting, dimming, Atman floating away, sun flickering orange, Prana withdrawing, koshas detaching, fading. RIGHT (DEAD): Lying, gray lifeless, Atman separated, sun dark, last Prana leaving crown, shell remains. Background: daylight → twilight → night. Timeline: T-72h, T-24h, T-6h, T-0. Cinematic storytelling, dramatic lighting, spiritual realism, IMAX quality 8K.
```

### Truth Revealed (Split Reality)

```
TOP HALF: Normal person in modern clothes, ordinary, eating food, appearing dependent. BOTTOM HALF: Same person revealed as luminous cosmic being - Atman (white star) at center extending to infinity, internal sun blazing creating internal universe, Prana as visible colored light-streams, five koshas as nested dolls containing galaxies, spine as cosmic axis, breath as Om vibrations, food fading (unnecessary), room as energy patterns, person-universe boundary dissolved. Sanskrit: "तत् त्वम् असि". Reality vs truth, mystical revelation, veil lifted, transcendent, 8K mind-expanding.
```
