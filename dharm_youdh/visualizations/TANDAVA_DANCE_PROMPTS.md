## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

**When sharing Shiva imagery:**

✅ **DO:**
- Treat with respect (sacred figure, not just art)
- Include Sanskrit mantras (ॐ नमः शिवाय)
- Explain symbolism clearly
- Credit traditional sources
- Use for teaching, not mockery

❌ **DON'T:**
- Trivialize or disrespect
- Use for commercial products without proper context
- Strip of spiritual meaning
- Present as purely "mythology" (it's physics!)
- Ignore traditional iconography rules

**Context is key:** Explain that Shiva represents cosmic transformation principle, not just "Hindu god" — this is universal physics represented through sacred art.

**These prompts bridge ancient sacred art with modern crisis visualization, creating powerful tools for awakening.**

*ॐ नमः शिवाय ॥*  
*Om Namah Shivaya — I bow to Shiva, the transformer, the consciousness within*

**The Tandava is not coming. The Tandava IS HERE.**  
**Visualize it. Share it. Wake humanity.**

*ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥*
