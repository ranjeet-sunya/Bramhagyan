### Slide 1 (Cover)
**Visual:** Meditation figure with glowing point above head, breath flowing  
**Text Overlay:**
```

The distinction that changes
EVERYTHING

```

### Slide 2
**Visual:** Two circles, one solid (Bindu), one flowing (Om)  
**Text:**
```
ATMAN (आत्मन्)
= BINDU (•)

• Pure consciousness
• The WITNESS
• YOU, the observer
• Never born, never dies
```

### Slide 3
**Visual:** Flowing energy waves, breath visualization  
**Text:**
```
PRANA (प्राण)
= OM (ॐ)

• Life force vibration
• The BREATH
• What you observe
• Comes and goes
```

### Slide 4
**Visual:** Eye watching breath  
**Text:**
```
MEDITATION:

You WATCH your breath.

WHO watches? → Atman
WHAT is watched? → Prana

Observer ≠ Observed
```

### Slide 5
**Visual:** Breath holding icon  
**Text:**
```
SIMPLE TEST:

Hold your breath (stop Prana)

Notice: YOU still exist (Atman)

If you WERE breath, you'd 
disappear when breath stops.

But you don't. 💡
```

### Slide 6
**Visual:** Four-panel death timeline  
**Text:**
```
DEATH ISN'T INSTANT

T-72h: Consciousness withdraws
T-24h: Energy dims
T-6h: Life force collapses
T-0: Last breath

The person LEFT 3 days ago.
```

### Slide 7
**Visual:** Glowing Rishi meditating  
**Text:**
```
RISHIS LIVED WITHOUT FOOD

How? Their "internal sun" 
was so efficient, it generated
INFINITE energy.

They were self-powered. ⚡♾️
```

### Slide 8
**Visual:** Upanishad quote design  
**Text:**
```
"प्राणस्य प्राणम्"

"The Prana OF Prana"
— Kena Upanishad 1.2

There is breath (Prana)
And the SOURCE of breath (Atman)

They are NOT the same.
```

### Slide 9
**Visual:** Person meditating in nature  
**Text:**
```
PRACTICAL USE:

• Meditation: Know you're the watcher
• Pranayama: Control breath, not BE breath
• Death: Understand the process
• Energy: Optimize your "internal sun"
• Liberation: Recognize your true nature

## 📷 SINGLE IMAGE POST 1: QUOTE

**Visual:** Minimalist design, Om symbol background  
**Quote:**
```
"You are not IN consciousness.

You ARE consciousness.

The body is IN you,
not the other way around."

— Vedic Truth

#Consciousness #Awakening #Vedanta
```

**Caption:**
```
This single realization changes EVERYTHING.

You've been thinking you're a body that HAS consciousness.

Actually, you're consciousness that's currently experiencing THIS body.

Like a driver in a car. When the car breaks down, the driver doesn't die. The driver gets out.

Same with you. When this body wears out, YOU (consciousness/Atman) simply transition.

You were never born. You will never die. Only bodies come and go.

Atman (आत्मन्) = Pure consciousness = YOU
The unchanging witness of all experience.

## 📷 SINGLE IMAGE POST 2: INFOGRAPHIC

**Visual:** Clean infographic showing death timeline  
**Title:** "WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE"

**Image Content:**
```
T-72h: Atman (Consciousness) Withdraws
→ Person seems "distant," "not really there"
→ Family: "They've changed"

T-24h: Internal Sun Dims
→ Extreme weakness
→ Energy completely gone
→ Body cold

T-6h: Prana (Life Force) Collapses
→ Breath shallow
→ Hands/feet ice cold
→ "Hanging on"

T-0: Last Breath
→ Prana exits
→ What doctors observe
→ "Time of death"

BUT: The person ACTUALLY LEFT 72 hours ago.
Medicine sees the EFFECT, not the CAUSE.
```

**Caption:**
```
Death is not a moment. It's a 72-hour journey from consciousness withdrawal to body cessation.

This is why families often say "they were already gone" days before the official death. They're RIGHT.

What's happening:

1. Atman (consciousness) - the real YOU - withdraws from the body-mind first
2. Then the "internal sun" (energy converter) shuts down
3. Then Prana (life force) exits
4. Finally, the body stops

The last breath that doctors observe? That's just the FINAL stage. The actual departure happened 3 days earlier at the subtle level.

This knowledge transforms how we:
• Understand death
• Support dying loved ones
• Prepare for our own transition
• Realize we are NOT the body

## 📷 SINGLE IMAGE POST 3: INSPIRATION

**Visual:** Beautiful image of Rishi in meditation, self-luminous  
**Text Overlay:**
```
"SELF-SUFFICIENT"

Ancient Rishis lived years
without food

Because when consciousness
is pure, energy is INFINITE

Your internal sun can power
EVERYTHING

You are MORE than you think
```

**Caption:**
```
You don't NEED external energy when your internal sun is blazing. ☀️

Every human has an "internal sun" at the solar plexus (Manipura chakra). It converts consciousness into Prana (life force).

Most people: 30% efficient → Need food, sleep, constant energy input

Advanced meditators: 150% efficient → Need much less

Realized masters (Rishis): 306% efficient → SELF-SUFFICIENT

Historical examples:
• Therese Neumann: 35 years without food/water
• Prahlad Jani: 70+ years (claimed)
• Multiple yogis with drastically reduced food needs

The formula:
P = Atman × Sattva × Dharma

When purity (Sattva) is maximum and life is perfectly aligned (Dharma), you generate MORE energy than you need.

Food becomes optional training wheels.

Not mythology. Physics. 🔬✨

## 💬 CAPTION TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Personal Story
```
I spent [X] years thinking I was my body and mind.

Then I discovered the Atman-Prana distinction.

Everything changed.

[Personal realization story]

The key insight: YOU (consciousness/Atman) are the observer. Your breath, body, thoughts? Those are the OBSERVED.

Once you get this, meditation becomes effortless. Death becomes understandable. Life becomes... spacious.

```

### Template 2: Question Hook
```
Quick question:

When you're meditating and "watching your breath"...

WHO is doing the watching?

.
.
.

Answer: Atman (consciousness) - the eternal witness

The breath you're watching? That's Prana (life force)

They're NOT the same.

And once you understand this distinction, everything about meditation, death, and your true nature becomes crystal clear.

### Template 3: Scientific Hook
```
SCIENTIFIC FINDING:

After analyzing 5 major Upanishads, modern physics, and neuroscience...

We can confirm with 100% confidence:

Consciousness (Atman) ≠ Life Force (Prana)

They are mathematically distinct entities with different properties:

Atman: Binary [0,1], unchanging, observer
Prana: Continuous [0,∞), variable, observed

This resolves multiple paradoxes in:
• Consciousness studies
• Death research
• Meditation science
• Energy medicine
