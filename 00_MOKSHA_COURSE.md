|   YOU are not IN the body.                                            |
|   The body is IN you.                                                 |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
|   YOU are not IN time.                                                |

|                                                                       |
|   YOU were never born.                                                |
|   Birth appeared IN you.                                              |
|                                                                       |
|   YOU will never die.                                                 |
|   Death will appear IN you.                                           |
|                                                                       |
|   YOU are the eternal witness — Awareness itself.                     |
|   This is what every scripture, every practice leads to.              |
|   This is Moksha. This is what you already are.                       |
|                                                                       |

|   ====================                                                |
|   The body appears in your awareness                                  |
|   You are the awareness in which it appears                           |
|                                                                       |
