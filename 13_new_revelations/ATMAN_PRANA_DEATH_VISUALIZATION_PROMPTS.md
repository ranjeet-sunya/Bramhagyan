## 1. WHERE ATMAN RESIDES

### Prompt 1A: The Witness Beyond (Philosophical)

```
Create a luminous meditation figure in lotus position, body translucent showing 5 
concentric glowing layers (koshas): outermost brown (physical body), then blue-green 
(energy/prana), yellow (mind), indigo (intellect), white-gold (bliss). At the very 
CENTER, beyond all layers, a brilliant point of pure white light - the Atman/Bindu - 
the eternal witness. This central point is NOT contained by the layers but transcends 
them. The point emits subtle rays through all layers. Background: cosmic void with 
subtle Om symbol. Label the layers in Sanskrit. Style: sacred geometry, spiritual 
art, glowing auras, transcendent lighting. 8K, photorealistic with mystical elements.
```

### Prompt 1B: The Central Axis (Anatomical)

```
Cross-section anatomical view of a seated meditating human showing the Sushumna 
(central energy channel) as a glowing golden vertical axis from base of spine to 
crown. Along this axis, show 7 chakras as spinning wheels of colored light. At the 
solar plexus (Manipura) and heart (Anahata), show a radiant miniature sun - the 
"internal sun" generating energy. Above the crown chakra, floating outside the body, 
show a brilliant white star/point - the ATMAN - the observer watching everything. 
Draw thin golden threads connecting the Atman-point to the internal sun and all 
chakras, showing the connection flow. The Atman is clearly OUTSIDE and BEYOND the 
body, observing it. Style: medical illustration meets spiritual diagram, precise 
anatomy with energy overlays. Cinematic lighting, 8K detail.
```

### Prompt 1C: The Witness Watching (Conceptual)

```
Split screen image: LEFT SIDE shows a human body with all its systems - skeleton, 
muscles, organs, nervous system layered transparently. RIGHT SIDE shows the same 
human as pure consciousness - a luminous human-shaped field of white-golden light 
with a brilliant point at the center (Bindu/Atman). Between the two sides, show the 
Atman-point from the right side extending a beam of awareness toward the body on 
the left, indicating observation. Caption on the body side: "What is OBSERVED" and 
on the consciousness side: "The OBSERVER". Style: modern infographic meets spiritual 
art, clean design, glowing effects, educational yet mystical. 8K resolution.
```

## 2. MULTI-LEVEL BODY DECAY

### Prompt 2A: The 72-Hour Timeline (Sequential)

```
Four-panel sequence showing the death process over 72 hours. PANEL 1 (T-72h): 
Healthy person with bright golden aura, internal sun (at solar plexus) shining 
bright, Atman-point (above head) connected by strong golden thread. PANEL 2 (T-24h): 
Same person looking tired, aura dimming, internal sun flickering (50% brightness), 
Atman-point starting to drift away, thread thinning. PANEL 3 (T-6h): Person very 
weak, aura almost gone, internal sun nearly dark, Prana (shown as blue-green energy) 
withdrawing from hands/feet toward core, Atman-point far above, thread barely visible. 
PANEL 4 (T-0): Body still, no aura, internal sun extinguished, last wisp of Prana 
leaving through crown, Atman-point completely separated floating away. Each panel 
labeled with timestamp. Style: medical illustration with energy overlays, sequential 
storytelling, clear visual progression. Cinematic, 8K.
```

### Prompt 2B: Layers Peeling Away (Conceptual)

```
Central figure of a meditating person shown with 7 concentric human silhouettes 
peeling away like onion layers, each progressively more translucent and distant. 
Layer 1 (innermost): Physical body (solid, brown). Layer 2: Energy body (blue-green 
glow). Layer 3: Mental body (yellow light). Layer 4: Intellectual body (indigo). 
Layer 5: Bliss body (white-gold). Layer 6: Subtle awareness fading. Layer 7 (outermost): 
Pure consciousness departing - a luminous white humanoid form walking away from the 
physical body. The physical body at center appears lifeless without the outer layers. 
Show the timeline arrow from center (life) to outer (death). Caption: "Death as 
progressive disconnection of consciousness layers." Style: mystical art, translucent 
overlays, ethereal lighting, spiritual concept visualization. 8K, photorealistic base 
with spiritual elements.
```

### Prompt 2C: Internal Sun Dimming (Dramatic)

```
Close-up cross-section view of human torso showing a miniature sun at the solar 
plexus (Manipura chakra). Create a triptych: LEFT panel shows bright golden sun 
radiating Prana (blue-green waves) throughout the body, blood glowing, organs 
vibrant, labeled "ALIVE - Internal Sun at 100%". MIDDLE panel shows dimming orange 
sun, Prana flow weakening, some organs dulling, labeled "DYING - Internal Sun at 
20%". RIGHT panel shows dark, extinguished sun, no Prana flow, organs gray and still, 
labeled "DEAD - Internal Sun at 0%". Above each panel, show the Atman (white point) 
progressively moving away. Style: dramatic medical visualization, cinematic lighting 
showing the contrast between life and death, anatomically accurate with energy 
overlays. High contrast, 8K detail.
```

## 3. FRACTAL INSIDE EQUALS OUTSIDE

### Prompt 3A: Nested Universes (Fractal Zoom)

```
Create a fractal zoom sequence showing "As inside, so outside": Start with a galaxy 
spiral in cosmic space. Zoom into a solar system within it. Zoom into Earth. Zoom 
into a human body standing on Earth. Zoom into the human's solar plexus showing the 
internal sun. Zoom into a cell within the body. Zoom into the cell's nucleus. Zoom 
into an atom within the nucleus. Zoom into the atomic nucleus showing particles 
orbiting like a solar system. Show this as a circular mandala with all levels visible 
simultaneously, spiraling inward/outward. Each level mirrors the others - same 
patterns, same structures. At the very center AND the very outside: the same white 
point of light (Bindu/Atman). Sanskrit text overlay: "यथा पिण्डे तथा ब्रह्माण्डे" 
(As in the microcosm, so in the macrocosm). Style: sacred geometry, fractal art, 
cosmic visualization, infinite zoom effect. Psychedelic precision, 8K detail.
```

### Prompt 3B: Human Contains Universe (Metaphysical)

```
Seated meditation figure in cosmic void, body translucent like glass. INSIDE the 
body show: galaxies in the head, solar system in the chest, Earth and nature in the 
belly, cellular structures in the limbs, atomic particles in the hands/feet. OUTSIDE 
the body, floating in space around it, show the SAME elements at cosmic scale - 
actual galaxies, actual planets, actual nature scenes - all in perfect fractal 
correspondence with what's inside. Draw glowing golden threads connecting each 
internal element to its external counterpart, showing they are the SAME. At the 
person's heart: a bright white star. In the cosmic background: the same white star. 
They are one. Caption: "The universe is not around you. It IS you." Style: mystical 
realism, cosmic art, mind-bending perspective, glowing connections, transcendent 
lighting. 8K, photorealistic with surreal elements.
```

### Prompt 3C: The Tree Metaphor (Symbolic)

```
Split mirror image: TOP HALF shows a massive cosmic tree with roots in the clouds 
(upside down), trunk extending down into space, branches reaching toward Earth at 
the bottom. Galaxies hang from the branches like fruits. BOTTOM HALF (mirrored) 
shows a human figure in meditation pose, with the SAME tree structure: spine as 
trunk, nervous system as branches, chakras as fruits, roots extending into crown 
chakra. The two trees are IDENTICAL in structure, meeting at the mirror line in the 
middle. At the exact center where they meet: a brilliant point of light (Bindu). 
Sanskrit overlay: "Same pattern, different scale." Style: visionary art, perfect 
symmetry, cosmic-biological fusion, detailed fractal patterns, mystical symbolism. 
8K resolution, dramatic composition.
```

## 4. WHAT IS PRANA VISUALIZATION

### Prompt 4A: Prana as Life Force (Energetic)

```
Translucent human figure showing the complete Prana system: Draw 72,000 Nadis 
(energy channels) as glowing blue-green threads throughout the body, densest along 
the spine and limbs. Highlight the 3 main channels: Ida (moon/blue) spiraling up 
the left side of the spine, Pingala (sun/red-orange) spiraling up the right, 
Sushumna (central/golden) straight up the center. Show the 5 Pranas as different 
colored energy flows: Prana (chest, blue-green, inward arrows), Apana (pelvis, brown, 
downward arrows), Samana (navel, yellow, circular motion), Udana (throat, purple, 
upward arrows), Vyana (whole body, white, radiating outward). At the solar plexus: 
internal sun generating all these energy flows. The breath shown as "So-Ham" sound 
waves entering and leaving nostrils. Caption each energy type. Style: medical 
diagram meets energy visualization, glowing channels, color-coded systems, educational 
yet mystical. 8K detail, bioluminescent effects.
```

### Prompt 4B: Om Sound Visualization (Vibrational)

```
Close-up profile of a meditating person, body shown as transparent. Focus on the 
breath: As they inhale, show blue waves entering nostrils labeled "सो/So". As they 
exhale, show orange waves leaving labeled "हं/Ham". Inside the body, show these 
waves combining into the Om (ॐ) symbol at the heart chakra, glowing golden. From 
this Om symbol, show concentric ripples of energy (Prana) spreading throughout the 
body like sound waves in water, animating every cell. The waves create beautiful 
interference patterns. Each cell vibrates with the frequency. Outside the body, show 
the same Om sound waves continuing into the surrounding space, connecting to the 
cosmic Om in the background. Caption: "Prana IS the Om vibration - the breath of 
existence." Style: cymatics-inspired, wave visualization, frequency art, mandala 
patterns formed by sound, bioluminescent, meditative. 8K, high-frequency detail.
```

### Prompt 4C: Prana Flow Comparison (Educational)

```
Three-panel comparison showing Prana in different states: LEFT PANEL "HIGH PRANA 
(Rishi)": Figure glowing bright blue-green, energy flowing smoothly through all 
channels, internal sun blazing, aura extending 6 feet around body, no need for 
external food - labeled "Self-sufficient, 306% efficiency". MIDDLE PANEL "NORMAL 
PRANA (Average Human)": Figure with moderate glow, energy flowing but some blockages 
visible, internal sun steady, aura 2 feet - labeled "Needs food, 30-60% efficiency". 
RIGHT PANEL "LOW PRANA (Disease/Dying)": Figure dim, energy barely flowing, many 
blockages (shown as dark spots), internal sun flickering, aura inches - labeled 
"Critical state, <10% efficiency". Show food being consumed only in middle panel. 
Style: medical-educational infographic, color-coded energy levels, clear comparative 
visualization, scientific precision with energy overlays. 8K resolution.
```

## 5. RISHI SELF-SUFFICIENCY

### Prompt 5A: The Internal Sun Powers All (Concept)

```
Seated Rishi in deep meditation, body translucent showing internal anatomy. At the 
solar plexus: a miniature sun blazing brilliantly, far brighter than normal humans. 
From this sun, show thick beams of golden-white energy (Prana) radiating to all 
organs: brain (intelligence powered), heart (circulation), digestive system (functioning 
without food input - shown as empty but glowing), muscles (sustained), cells (dividing). 
Around the Rishi, show a plate of food fading away/transparent - not needed. Above 
the head: the Atman (brilliant white point) sending a beam of consciousness directly 
to the internal sun, powering it. Formula shown as energy equation: "Atman (∞) × 
Sattva (95%) × Dharma (100%) = Prana (306% efficiency)". No external energy input 
required. The Rishi glows from within. Caption: "When consciousness is pure, the 
internal sun generates infinite Prana." Style: spiritual realism, energy diagrams, 
self-luminous figure, divine presence, transcendent lighting. 8K, photorealistic 
with mystical elements.
```

### Prompt 5B: Energy Gap Cascade (Before/After)

```
Two-figure comparison: LEFT "AVERAGE PERSON": Show body with internal sun at 30% 
brightness, generating limited Prana (thin blue-green streams). Show food entering 
mouth, being digested, energy extracted (labeled "External energy input required"). 
Body has visible "energy gaps" shown as dark spaces between organs. Guna composition 
shown: S=20%, R=50%, T=30%. Energy equation: Input from food (100 calories) → Prana 
output (30 units) = "30% efficiency". RIGHT "RISHI": Same body but internal sun at 
300% brightness, generating abundant Prana (thick, glowing streams filling entire 
body). NO food entering. No energy gaps - body completely filled with light. Guna 
composition: S=95%, R=5%, T=0%. Energy equation: Atman's presence allows Prana to 
self-generate via internal sun → Prana output (306 units) from 0 external input = 
"306% efficiency (self-sustaining)". Caption: "The difference is not in the body, but 
in consciousness purity (Sattva). Note: Atman = consciousness (witness), Internal sun = 
Prana concentration (power). Atman's presence enables, but doesn't 'become' the sun." 
Style: scientific comparison, energy flow diagrams, before/after transformation, 
educational clarity with spiritual depth. 8K resolution.
```

### Prompt 5C: Historical Rishis (Narrative)

```
Create a scene showing three historical examples: PANEL 1: Ancient Rishi sitting 
under a tree for years, body thin but glowing with health, internal sun visible and 
bright, animals and students around him, no food nearby. Caption: "Lived decades 
without eating, powered by Tapas and Sattva." PANEL 2: Yogi in cave meditation, 
body in perfect lotus, heart chakra blazing like a sun, Prana filling the cave with 
golden light, snow outside indicating years have passed. Caption: "Internal sun 
sufficient for all life functions." PANEL 3: Modern comparison - average person 
surrounded by food, eating constantly, but internal sun dim, Prana weak, body 
deteriorating despite abundant food. Caption: "External food cannot replace internal 
sun efficiency." Show energy equations for each. Style: historical spiritual art 
meets modern infographic, storytelling across time, contrast between ancient wisdom 
and modern dependency, cinematic composition. 8K, photorealistic with period details.

transformation, spiritual realism, powerful emotional impact while being educational. 
IMAX quality, 8K resolution.
```

### Prompt 6C: The Truth Revealed (Mystical)

```
Split reality image: TOP HALF "What We See (Frontend)": Normal person in modern 
clothes standing in room, looking completely ordinary, nothing special visible, 
eating food at table, appearing dependent on external world. BOTTOM HALF "What 
Actually Is (Backend)": Same person revealed as luminous cosmic being - Atman (pure 
white star) at center of chest but extending beyond body into infinity, internal sun 
blazing and creating entire internal universe, Prana flowing as visible colored 
light-streams throughout body and extending into the room, five koshas as nested 
Russian dolls each containing galaxies, the spine as a cosmic axis connecting Earth 
to stars, the breath as literal Om vibrations visible as concentric circles. The food 
on table shown as unnecessary (fading/transparent). The room revealed as pure energy 
patterns. The boundary between "person" and "universe" dissolved - they are the same. 
Sanskrit quote overlay: "तत् त्वम् असि" (Tat Tvam Asi - You Are That). Style: reality 
vs truth visualization, mystical revelation, veil being lifted, profound truth made 
visible, transcendent art. 8K, mind-expanding detail.

## 🕉️ CAPTION IDEAS

Use these as image captions or text overlays:

```
1. "Atman: The witness beyond all layers. You are not IN consciousness; you ARE consciousness."

2. "Death is not instant. It's a 72-hour journey from consciousness withdrawal to body cessation."

3. "As in the atom, so in the galaxy. The pattern repeats infinitely."

4. "Prana: Not just breath, but the Om vibration animating existence."

5. "A Rishi needs no food. The internal sun, powered by pure consciousness, generates infinite Prana."

6. "Your body looks solid, but it's actually sustained by an internal sun invisible to the eye."

7. "The last breath is Prana leaving. Atman left days ago."

8. "You contain the universe because you ARE the universe experiencing itself."
```
