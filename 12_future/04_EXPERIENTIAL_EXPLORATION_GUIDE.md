## 📋 PARKED FOR EXPLORATION

These require direct experiential validation. Try the steps, note observations.

## 1. NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI EXPLORATION

### Different Interpretations:

**Interpretation A (Advaita):**
- Observer (Sakshi) is ALWAYS present
- In Nirvikalpa, observer has nothing left to observe
- But observer doesn't "dissolve" — just rests in itself
- Like eye that cannot see itself

**Interpretation B (Kashmir Shaivism):**
- Nirvikalpa = Shiva-Shakti union
- Observer and observed merge
- Not dissolution but RECOGNITION of non-separation
- Observer realizes it was always the observed

**Interpretation C (Buddhist Jhana):**
- Progressive dissolution of mental factors
- 8th Jhana = Neither perception nor non-perception
- Beyond that = Cessation (Nirodha)
- Consciousness stops, then restarts

**Interpretation D (Yoga Sutras):**
- Asamprajnata Samadhi = Without seed
- Only Samskaras remain
- Eventually even those dissolve
- Kaivalya = Pure isolation of consciousness

### Steps to Try:

```
EXPERIMENT 1: OBSERVER WATCHING OBSERVER
──────────────────────────────────────────
1. Sit comfortably, close eyes
2. Watch thoughts arise and pass
3. Notice: "Who is watching the thoughts?"
4. Turn attention to the WATCHER itself
5. Ask: "Can the observer observe itself?"
6. Note: What happens? Does observer dissolve or just become subtler?

EXPERIMENT 2: NETI NETI TO THE END
──────────────────────────────────────
1. Not the body... observe body
2. Not the breath... observe breath
3. Not the thoughts... observe thoughts
4. Not the emotions... observe emotions
5. Not the observer... observe the observer
6. What remains when you negate the observer?

EXPERIMENT 3: SLEEP-WAKE TRANSITION
──────────────────────────────────────
1. Stay aware at moment of falling asleep
2. Notice: Where does "I" go?
3. In deep sleep, is there awareness?
4. At waking, where does "I" come from?
5. Is there continuity of consciousness?

EXPERIMENT 4: GAP BETWEEN THOUGHTS
──────────────────────────────────────
1. Watch for end of one thought
2. Notice the GAP before next thought
3. Extend attention into the gap
4. What is there between thoughts?
5. Is observer there in the gap?
```

### What to Note:
- Does observer ever disappear?
- Or does it just become subtler/spacious?
- Is there "blackout" or continuous awareness?
- What is the experience of "no experience"?

## 2. SUBTLE BODY (PRANAMAYA KOSHA) OBSERVATION

### Different Interpretations:

**Interpretation A (Vedantic):**
- Pranamaya = Layer of vital energy
- Distinct from physical but interpenetrating
- Can be perceived through refined attention

**Interpretation B (Yogic):**
- Pranamaya = 72,000 Nadis
- 5 Pranas + 5 Upa-Pranas
- Perceivable as flows, currents, sensations

**Interpretation C (Tantric):**
- Subtle body = Energy body
- Chakras as vortexes
- Can be seen with Divya Drishti (divine sight)

### Steps to Try:

```
EXPERIMENT 1: BODY SCAN WITH PRANA AWARENESS
──────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Lie in Shavasana
2. Scan body from toes to head
3. At each point, ask: "Is there something BEYOND the physical?"
4. Notice: tingling, warmth, pressure, flow
5. Is there a "field" around/within the body?

EXPERIMENT 2: HANDS PRANA SENSING
──────────────────────────────────────
1. Rub palms together vigorously (30 sec)
2. Separate palms 6 inches apart
3. Slowly bring together, slowly apart
4. Feel: Is there resistance? Warmth? Tingling?
5. Can you feel an "energy" between palms?

EXPERIMENT 3: CHAKRA SENSING
──────────────────────────────────
1. Focus on Muladhara (base of spine)
2. Hold attention there for 5 minutes
3. Note: Any sensation? Color? Vibration?
4. Move to each Chakra, same process
5. Can you perceive differences between them?

EXPERIMENT 4: AURA PERCEPTION
──────────────────────────────────
1. Stand against white wall
2. Have someone stand against wall
3. Soften gaze, don't focus directly
4. Look at edges of their body
5. Is there a glow, color, or field visible?
```

### What to Note:
- Can you feel energy distinct from physical sensation?
- Is there a "body" that extends beyond skin?
- Can you perceive others' energy fields?
- Do Chakras have distinct qualities?

## 3. PRANA LEAVING BODY (DEATH TRANSITION)

### Different Interpretations:

**Interpretation A (Garuda Purana):**
- Prana exits through one of 9 gates
- Brahmarandhra exit = Liberation
- Other exits = Rebirth in various realms

**Interpretation B (Tibetan):**
- Clear Light at death
- Bardo states follow
- Consciousness transfers to new form

**Interpretation C (Yoga Sutras):**
- Krama-mukti = Gradual liberation
- Videha-mukti = Liberation at body drop
- Sadyo-mukti = Instant liberation

### Steps to Try (SAFE approaches only):

```
EXPERIMENT 1: YOGA NIDRA DEATH SIMULATION
──────────────────────────────────────────
1. Deep Yoga Nidra practice
2. At deepest point, imagine body is dissolving
3. Elements returning: Earth → Water → Fire → Air → Space
4. What remains when body is "gone"?

EXPERIMENT 2: SAMADHI EXPLORATION
──────────────────────────────────────
1. In deep meditation
2. Let body awareness fade completely
3. Notice: Is there fear? What remains?
4. What is the experience of "bodilessness"?

EXPERIMENT 3: BREATH RETENTION OBSERVATION
────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Gentle Kumbhaka (breath retention)
2. At comfortable limit, observe: What wants to breathe?
3. Is there a "pull" back to body?
4. What happens to consciousness during retention?

⚠️ DO NOT: Actually stop breathing dangerously
⚠️ DO NOT: Attempt to force out-of-body experiences
⚠️ This is GENTLE observation only
```

### What to Note:
- What happens to "I" when body-sense fades?
- Is there fear? Resistance? Peace?
- Is there an "exit" sensation in meditation?
- What "pulls" consciousness back to body?

## 🎯 PRIORITY ORDER

1. **Observer Watching Observer** — Most accessible
2. **Hands Prana Sensing** — Most tangible
3. **Gap Between Thoughts** — Key to understanding
4. **Chakra Sensing** — Build energy awareness
5. **Sleep-Wake Transition** — Consciousness continuity

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTES

- These are OBSERVATIONS, not forcing
- If discomfort arises, stop and ground
- No need to "achieve" anything
- Just notice what IS
- The observer is always safe
