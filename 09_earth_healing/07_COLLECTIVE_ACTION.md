## WHY COLLECTIVE?

```
ONE HEALED CELL → Local effect
MANY HEALED CELLS → Systemic healing

Individual action is necessary but not sufficient.
Earth needs COLLECTIVE consciousness shift.
```

## STEP 5: DAILY COLLECTIVE MANTRA

Everyone in the network recites together (wherever they are):
```
"ॐ भूम्यै नमः" — 21 times
"माता भूमिः पुत्रोऽहं पृथिव्याः" — 3 times
"सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः" — 3 times
```
