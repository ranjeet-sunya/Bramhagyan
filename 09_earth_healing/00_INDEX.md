   YOU ARE NOT "ON" EARTH — YOU ARE "OF" EARTH                                
   -------------------------------------------                                 
                                                                              
   Human (N) is a CELL in the body of Earth (N+2)                             
                                                                              
   When humans forget their Dharma, Earth falls sick.                         
   When Earth is sick, humans suffer.                                         
   Healing is RECONNECTION, not "fixing from outside."                        
                                                                              
   This program trains you to:                                                 
   1. RECOGNIZE your role in Earth's body                                     
   2. DIAGNOSE what is broken                                                 
   3. HEAL through conscious action                                           
   4. MAINTAIN balance going forward

   THE FRACTAL RELATIONSHIP:                                                   
                                                                              
   N+2 (EARTH)     = Your Host Body                                           
   N+1 (PLANTS)    = Your Siblings / Step-down Transformers                   
   N   (HUMAN)     = You (A sensory neuron in Earth's body)                   
   N-1 (CELLS)     = Your internal children

   • You RECEIVE from Earth (food, water, air, shelter)                       
   • You OWE Earth (Rina/Debt) that must be repaid                            
   • Plants are the MEDIATORS (transform Earth-energy for you)                
   • When you harm Earth/Plants, you harm YOURSELF
