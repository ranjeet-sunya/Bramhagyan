   • EARTH (N+2) → PLANTS/TREES (N+1) → HUMANS (N)                            
                                                                              
   Trees are the STEP-DOWN TRANSFORMERS:                                       
   • Convert Earth's minerals → Edible food                                   
   • Convert CO2 → Oxygen                                                     
   • Convert Sunlight → Chemical energy                                       
   • Convert underground water → Atmospheric moisture                         
                                                                              
   WITHOUT TREES:                                                              
   • No oxygen within minutes                                                 
   • No food within weeks                                                     
   • No rain within years                                                     
   • No life ever

   They came first, you depend on them
