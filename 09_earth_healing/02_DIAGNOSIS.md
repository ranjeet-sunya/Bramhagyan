   • 2025-2028 — Kali-Dwapara Sandhya (transition window)                     
   • This is the WINDOW for conscious shift                                   
   • After this, changes become harder

   • Old patterns are breaking down                                           
   • New patterns can be established

   • Earth will heal herself (through Pralaya)                                
   • This means mass extinction events                                        
   • Humans will suffer most (most disconnected)
