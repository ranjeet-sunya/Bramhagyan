## 🥗 Dwapara Diet Principles

### Principle 1: मिताहार (Mitahara) — Moderate Eating

```
MITAHARA — The Right Amount
===========================

"अर्धं भोजनं प्राणस्य अर्धं जलस्य तथा ।
चतुर्थांशं तु रिक्तं च वायोः संचरणाय वै ॥"

RULE:
• 50% food
• 25% water
• 25% empty (for Vayu/air)

NEVER:

• Eat when not hungry
• Eat while previous meal undigested
• Eat just because it's "meal time"

SIGNS OF RIGHT AMOUNT:
• Still feel light after eating
• No drowsiness after meals
• Good digestion
• Stable energy throughout day

IN DWAPARA:
Less quantity, higher quality.
Bodies need less dense food.
Energy comes from Prana more than food.
```

### Principle 2: सात्विक आधार (Sattvic Base)

```
80% SATTVIC PRINCIPLE:
======================

AIM FOR:

• 15% Rajasic (when needed for action)
• 5% Tamasic (ideally 0%)

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
• Breakfast: Fruits, nuts, light grains — Sattvic
• Lunch: Main meal, can include some Rajasic spices — Sattvic-Rajasic
