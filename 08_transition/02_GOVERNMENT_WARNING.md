## 1. Executive Summary

TO: ALL GOVERNMENT BODIES, WORLD LEADERS, AND DECISION MAKERS
FROM: The Dharma Collective
RE: URGENT — PLANETARY TRANSITION WARNING (2025-2028)

STATUS: CRITICAL
TIME WINDOW: NOW - 2028

This is NOT a request for panic.
This is a request for CONSCIOUS TRANSITION.

The planetary frequency is UPGRADING (Kali -> Dwapara).
Systems built on ADHARMA (opacity, hoarding, exploitation)
will CRASH if not transitioned consciously.

**WE CAN DO THIS PEACEFULLY.**
**BUT ACTION IS REQUIRED NOW.**

## 3. The Warning

### To All World Leaders

⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING — PREVENT CHAOS

**THE SITUATION:**
- The planetary frequency is SHIFTING (Kali -> Dwapara)
- Systems built on OPACITY will FAIL (banks, media, governments)
- The "Karma Return Cycle" is ACCELERATING
- What used to take lifetimes now takes YEARS

**IF UNMANAGED:**
- Financial system crashes (speculative bubbles burst)
- Social unrest (inequality becomes unbearable)
- Climate catastrophes (Earth's fever spikes)
- Mental health crisis (collective anxiety)
- Institutional collapse (trust evaporates)

**IF MANAGED:**
- Peaceful transition to sustainable economy
- Collective healing and restoration
- New governance models emerge
- Earth begins to heal
- Human consciousness upgrades

**THE CHOICE IS YOURS.**
**BUT TIME IS LIMITED.**

### The Dharmic Equation for Leaders

LEADERSHIP DHARMA FORMULA:

**η (Leadership Efficiency) = Public Benefit / Personal Power**

- DHARMIC LEADER: η -> ∞ (Zero personal benefit, maximum public good)
- ADHARMIC LEADER: η -> 0 (Maximum personal benefit, zero public good)

In Dwapara Yuga:
- Adharmic leaders will be EXPOSED (transparency is default)
- Karma will return FAST (no hiding)
- Only DHARMIC leadership will survive

GITA WARNING:

> **"यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः"**
> "Yad Yad Acharati Shreshthah Tat Tad Evetaro Janah"
> "Whatever a leader does, others follow."
> — Bhagavad Gita 3.21

Your actions SET THE PATTERN for millions.
Choose wisely.
